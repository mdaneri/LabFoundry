# Routing And WAN Roadmap

LabFoundry Routing/WAN v1 is intentionally appliance-owned and conservative. Desired state is edited on `/routes-wan`; host mutation happens only through the global `/appliance-apply` `wan` unit.

LabFoundry has no `wan` interface role. The `wan` apply-unit name and WAN Simulation UI describe explicit routing, NAT, and impairment behavior only; they must not be used as an interface classification.

## Current V1 Scope

- Static route desired state rendered to `/var/lib/labfoundry/apply/wan/labfoundry-wan.conf`.
- Separate route tables for management and lab networks: management keeps its own default gateway, while non-management routes install into the lab route table.
- Routing permissions for lab forwarding. Route-role networks forward to other route-role networks by default; access networks need explicit routing rules.
- IPv4 outbound masquerade NAT rules rendered as the LabFoundry-owned `table ip labfoundry_nat`.
- NAT outbound interfaces can be access physical interfaces with IPv4 CIDRs or enabled VLAN interfaces with IPv4 CIDRs; NAT eligibility is not inferred from an interface role.
- IPv4 forwarding enabled only when enabled lab routing or NAT requires it.
- Management is never a route, NAT, or routing-permission target, and firewall apply generates explicit management-to-lab and lab-to-management forward drops.
- Interface/VLAN-level WAN simulation through one `tc qdisc replace dev <target> root netem ...` per target with an enabled assigned policy.
- Disabled or unassigned WAN policy targets clear only LabFoundry-owned root qdisc intent.
- Route commands use `ip route replace <destination> [via <gateway>] dev <interface> metric <metric> table 200`.

`wan_mode=interface` is the only supported WAN impairment mode in v1. Route-specific impairment is not exposed in the UI or public API until it has a real helper implementation.

## Planned Route-Specific Impairment

Route-specific WAN impairment should let an operator attach a WAN policy to traffic matching a route or route-like destination without impairing all traffic on that interface. This is planned work, not current behavior.

Before exposing a `route` mode, the design needs to settle:

- Packet classification approach: `tc` filters, nftables packet marks, policy routing, or another Photon-safe mechanism.
- Conflict behavior when multiple routes, NAT rules, firewall rules, or service listeners match the same packets.
- Rollback semantics for marks, filters, chains, and qdisc state based on the last-applied LabFoundry baseline.
- Observability in previews and jobs so operators can see every mark/filter/qdisc command that will run.
- Photon verification commands that prove only the intended destination traffic is impaired.

The likely implementation shape is:

1. Render explicit route impairment entries in the staged WAN config.
2. Validate destination CIDRs, target interfaces, mark IDs, and policy references in `labfoundry-helper wan validate`.
3. Install a LabFoundry-owned classification layer, avoiding broad rewrites of unrelated nftables or `tc` state.
4. Apply `tc` filters and netem classes only for tracked LabFoundry-owned route impairment entries.
5. Remove disabled or removed route impairment only when it appears in the last-applied baseline.

## NAT Roadmap

NAT v1 is explicit IPv4 masquerade only. Future NAT work can consider:

- Destination NAT and port forwarding with clear listener ownership.
- Per-rule counters or status readback.
- IPv6 routing is supported through `ip -6 route`; IPv6 NAT/NPT remains future work only if a concrete lab use case justifies it.

Do not infer broad NAT automatically from interface roles. NAT must remain an explicit desired-state rule reviewed through global appliance apply.

## Verification

Live Photon validation for Routing/WAN changes should inspect both the LabFoundry preview/job and the host state:

```bash
ip route
tc qdisc show
nft list ruleset
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
systemctl status labfoundry-nat.service --no-pager
```

For route-specific impairment work, add packet-level validation that shows matching destination traffic is impaired while unrelated traffic on the same interface is not.
