# Managed LDAP for VCF Automation 9.1

LabFoundry can operate a single OpenLDAP 2.6 service for VCF Automation while keeping each VCF organization in a separate LDAP naming context and LMDB database. This service is independent from LabFoundry operator authentication: LabFoundry sign-in remains local in v1.

## Security boundary

- LDAPS is enabled by default on configurable TCP port 636 and uses a CA-managed certificate.
- Optional plaintext LDAP is disabled by default and has an independently configurable TCP port, defaulting to 389. Enabling it exposes credentials and directory data without transport encryption, so use it only on an isolated lab network when a client cannot use LDAPS.
- Privileged reconciliation uses local `ldapi:///` with SASL EXTERNAL through `labfoundry-helper ldap`.
- The integrated LabFoundry CA issues the `ldap:ldaps` certificate for the configured hostname and listener addresses whenever LDAPS is enabled.
- Firewall apply owns rules for each enabled LDAP/LDAPS port on selected addressed access or route interfaces and enabled VLANs. Management interfaces are not eligible LDAP listener targets.
- Each organization receives a separate suffix and database. Its generated VCF bind identity can read only that suffix.
- VCF bind secrets are encrypted with `LABFOUNDRY_SECRETS_KEY`. A generated or rotated secret is displayed once.
- User passwords are held only in process memory until global LDAP apply. Password plaintext and hashes are never stored in the application database, previews, tasks, or audit details.

The default organization layout is:

```text
dc=<organization>,dc=ldap,dc=labfoundry,dc=internal
├── ou=users
├── ou=groups
├── ou=service-accounts
└── ou=system
```

## Directory behavior

The helper generates one MDB database per enabled organization and configures the `ppolicy`, `memberof`, and referential-integrity overlays. Groups use DN-valued `member` attributes and may contain users or groups. LabFoundry rejects cross-organization members and direct or indirect group cycles before save and again during helper validation.

The default password policy requires 14 characters with uppercase, lowercase, number, special-character, and username checks. Five failures lock a user for 15 minutes, and five previous passwords are retained. Expiry is disabled by default because v1 has no end-user password-change portal. Administrators can stage password resets, enable or disable users, and request an unlock; enforcement occurs only through global LDAP apply.

The Directory UI treats organizations like DNS zones: each organization is a tab and `+ Organization` opens an in-context creation panel. Users and groups use editable Tabulator grids with bottom add rows and row menus for password, membership, unlock, and deletion actions. **Generate test directory** asks for user and group counts, invents complete synthetic identities and memberships, and shows generated passwords once; those passwords follow the same in-memory-only staging boundary as manually entered passwords. If LabFoundry restarts before those passwords are applied, VCF Helper summarizes the affected users per organization and **Stage missing passwords** generates replacement credentials in one operation with a new one-time CSV.

## VCF Automation integration

Open the **Managed LDAP for VCF** tile on the VCF Helper page for both manual bundles and the guided inspection, configuration, and verification workflow. The Managed LDAP page remains focused on directory service settings, organizations, accounts, and groups. Encrypted LDAP recovery is integrated into Backup / Restore as a separate LDAP-specific archive.

Every organization can download a manual ZIP bundle containing the selected VCF LDAP endpoint, root CA PEM when LDAPS is used, search bases, bind DN, VCF Automation 9.1 JSON, and operator instructions. The bind password is intentionally separate. Generated VCF settings prefer LDAPS whenever it is enabled; plaintext LDAP is used only when LDAPS is disabled and LDAP is enabled.

The guided workflow pins the VCF Automation TLS SHA-256 fingerprint, reads current organization LDAP settings, requires explicit replacement approval, writes `settingsSource=DEFINED`, tests LDAP, and verifies that VCF can find at least one user and group. Administrator credentials are transient and are not stored.

The VCF 9.1 mapping includes:

```json
{
  "userAttributes": {
    "serviceAccount": "employeeType"
  }
}
```

LabFoundry does not import LDAP groups into VCF or assign VCF organization roles. Complete those steps in VCF Automation and retain local break-glass administrators.

## Apply and recovery

The `ldap` apply unit stages secret-bearing JSON at `/var/lib/labfoundry/apply/ldap/labfoundry-ldap.json` with mode `0600`. The file is excluded from previews and task payloads and removed after helper processing. When LDAP-related CA, DNS, or firewall desired state changes, global appliance apply submits the changed dependency units together.

Normal settings backup contains LDAP metadata but no bind secrets or password hashes. Use the separate passphrase-encrypted LDAP recovery export to preserve `slapcat` data. Recovery import decrypts and validates the archive in memory, then stages it for the next global LDAP apply. A restart before apply requires the archive and passphrase again.
