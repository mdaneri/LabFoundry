# VCF Certificate Trust

VCF Certificate Trust deploys the active LabFoundry root CA to one VCF 9
Installer or SDDC Manager appliance. Open it from the `VCF Certificate Trust`
button on `/vcf-helper`. It is a remote maintenance task, not DNS desired state
and not an Appliance Apply unit.

For an existing appliance, create a current VM snapshot or equivalent rollback
point before changing trust. The wizard collects only:

- target VCF API endpoint, as `host`, `host:port`, or `https://host:port`;
- one-time VCF API administrator credentials;
- target HTTPS TLS fingerprint confirmation;
- snapshot acknowledgment.

LabFoundry never persists the API password. It stores only sanitized target,
port, role/version, confirmed TLS fingerprint, deployed CA fingerprint, and task
result metadata.

The task authenticates through `POST /v1/tokens`, detects the appliance using
`GET /v1/system/appliance-info`, checks
`GET /v1/sddc-manager/trusted-certificates`, and imports missing outbound trust
through `POST /v1/sddc-manager/trusted-certificates`. An identical certificate
is a successful no-op.

VCF Installer and SDDC Manager both use the same API-only flow. LabFoundry does
not SSH to the appliance and does not restart SDDC Manager services. API
verification means the certificate is present in the VCF trusted-certificate
API after import. VCF releases before 9.x and certificate deletion are outside
this release.

Routes:

- `GET /vcf-trust` redirects compatibility links to
  `/vcf-helper?vcf_trust=1`, which opens the modal.
- `POST /vcf-helper/trust-root-ca/inspect-target` confirms target HTTPS TLS,
  validates API credentials, and returns role/version.
- `POST /vcf-trust/root-ca` queues the task and redirects to
  `/tasks?job_id=<id>`.
- `POST /vcf-helper/trust-root-ca` remains a compatibility alias for cached
  clients.
