## Scripted installation approaches

You can install ESX on multiple machines by using either:

- A single installation script for all machines.
- A separate installation script for each machine.

For example, disk names can vary from host to host, so one common setting to control in a script is the disk selected for ESX installation.

| Scenario | Recommended action |
| --- | --- |
| Always install on the first disk across multiple machines. | Create one script. |
| Install ESX on a different disk for each machine. | Create multiple scripts. |

For the commands required to specify the installation disk, see [Installation and upgrade script commands](#installation-and-upgrade-script-commands).

---

## Enter boot options for a scripted install

At boot time, you might need to specify options to access the kickstart file.

- In the boot loader, press **Shift+O** to edit boot options.
- For PXE boot installation, pass options through the `kernelopt` line of the `boot.cfg` file.
- To specify the location of the installation script, set `ks=filepath`, where `filepath` is the location of the kickstart file.
- If `ks=filepath` is omitted, the text installer runs instead of a scripted install.

### Manual boot-option example

At the `runweasel` prompt, type the `ks=` location plus any other boot command-line options:

```text
ks=http://00.00.00.00/kickstart/ks-osdc-pdp101.cfg nameserver=00.00.0.0 ip=00.00.00.000 netmask=255.255.255.0 gateway=00.00.00.000
```

## Boot options

### Supported boot options for ESX installation

| Boot option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `BOOTIF=hwtype-MAC address` | Similar to `netdevice`, except in PXELINUX format as described by the `IPAPPEND` option in SYSLINUX. |
| `gateway=ip address` | Sets the network gateway used to download the installation script and installation media. |
| `ip=ip address` | Sets a static IP address used to download the installation script and installation media. PXELINUX format is also supported. |
| `ks=cdrom:/path` | Performs a scripted installation with the script at `path` on the CD-ROM drive. Each CD-ROM is mounted and checked until the file is found. |
| `ks=file://path` | Performs a scripted installation with the script at `path`. |
| `ks=protocol://serverpath` | Performs a scripted installation with a script located on the network. Supported protocols are `http`, `https`, `ftp`, and `nfs`. Example: `ks=nfs://host/porturl-path`. |
| `ks=usb` | Performs a scripted installation using `ks.cfg` from the root of an attached USB drive. Only FAT16 and FAT32 are supported. |
| `ks=usb:/path` | Performs a scripted installation with the script at the specified USB path. |
| `ksdevice=device` | Uses a specific network adapter when looking for the installation script and media. Specify a MAC address, such as `00:50:56:C0:00:01`, or a `vmnicNN` name. |
| `nameserver=ip address` | Specifies a DNS server used to download the installation script and media. |
| `netdevice=device` | Uses a specific network adapter when looking for the installation script and media. Specify a MAC address or `vmnicNN`. |
| `netmask=subnet mask` | Specifies the subnet mask for the network interface used to download the script and media. |
| `vlanid=vlanid` | Configures the network card to use the specified VLAN. |
| `systemMediaSize` | Increases the size of system storage partitions on the boot media. Supported values are `default` and `max`. |

`systemMediaSize` values:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `default` | 138 GB. |
| `max` | Consume all available space, useful for multi-terabyte servers. |

> Important: The ESX installer does **not** validate SSL certificates for URLs. Verify URLs before using them.

---

## Default `ks.cfg` installation script

The default `ks.cfg` installation script is located in the initial RAM disk at:

```text
/etc/vmware/weasel/ks.cfg
```

You can specify the default script by using this boot option:

```text
ks=file://etc/vmware/weasel/ks.cfg
```

When installing ESX using the default `ks.cfg` script, the default root password is:

```text
myp@ssw0rd
```

You cannot modify the default script on the installation media. After installation, use the vSphere Client to log in to the vCenter managing the ESX host and modify settings.

With ESX 8.0 and later, if the system has supported data processing units (DPUs), the `ks.cfg` script can also install ESX on the DPUs.

### Default sample script

```kickstart
# Sample scripted installation file

# Accept the VMware End User License Agreement
vmaccepteula

# Set the root password for the DCUI and Tech Support Mode
rootpw myp@ssw0rd

# Install on the first local disk available on the machine
install --firstdisk --overwritevmfs

# If the system has DPUs, also specify a PCI slot:
# install --firstdisk --overwritevmfs --dpupcislots=<PCIeSlotID>

# Set the network to DHCP on the first network adapter
network --bootproto=dhcp --device=vmnic0

# A sample post-install script
%post --interpreter=python --ignorefailure=true
import time
stampFile = open('/finished.stamp', mode='w')
stampFile.write(time.asctime())
```

---

## `boot.cfg` file

The boot loader configuration file, `boot.cfg`, specifies:

- The kernel.
- Kernel options.
- Boot modules used by `mboot.c32` or `mboot.efi`.

The file is provided in the ESX installer. Modify the `kernelopt` line to specify the installation script location or pass other boot options.

### `boot.cfg` syntax

```ini
# boot.cfg -- mboot configuration file
# Any line preceded with '#' is a comment.

title=STRING
prefix=DIRPATH
kernel=FILEPATH
kernelopt=STRING
modules=FILEPATH1---FILEPATH2...---FILEPATHn

# Any other line must remain unchanged.
```

### `boot.cfg` commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `title=STRING` | Sets the boot loader title to `STRING`. |
| `prefix=DIRPATH` | Optional. Adds `DIRPATH/` before every `FILEPATH` in the `kernel=` and `modules=` commands that does not already start with `/` or `http://`. |
| `kernel=FILEPATH` | Sets the kernel path to `FILEPATH`. |
| `kernelopt=STRING` | Appends `STRING` to the kernel boot options. |
| `modules=FILEPATH1---FILEPATH2...---FILEPATHn` | Lists modules to load, separated by three hyphens: `---`. |

---

## Installation and upgrade script commands

To modify the default installation or upgrade script, or to create your own, use the supported kickstart commands.

To determine which disk to install or upgrade ESX on, the installation script requires one of these commands:

- `install`
- `upgrade`
- `installorupgrade`

The `install` command creates the default partitions, including a VMFS datastore that occupies all available space after other partitions are created.

With ESX 8.0 and later, if the system has supported DPUs, consider installation or reinstallation of ESX on DPUs along with ESX on hosts. ESX update and upgrade on DPUs is not supported by interactive or scripted methods. Use vSphere Lifecycle Manager for DPU update or upgrade.

The use of SD and USB devices for storing ESX-OSData partitions is deprecated. SD and USB devices can only be used to create boot bank partitions: boot-bank 0 and boot-bank 1. You can provide a persistent disk of at least 32 GB for ESX-OSData by using `systemDisk` with the `install` command.

### Core commands

| Command | Required | Description |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `accepteula` or `vmaccepteula` | Yes | Accepts the ESX license agreement. |
| `clearpart` | No | Clears existing partitions on the disk. Requires `install`. Carefully edit this command in existing scripts. |
| `dryrun` | No | Parses and checks the installation script but does not install. |
| `install` | Conditional | Specifies a fresh installation. One of `install`, `upgrade`, or `installorupgrade` is required. |
| `installorupgrade` | Conditional | Installs or upgrades. One of `install`, `upgrade`, or `installorupgrade` is required. |
| `keyboard` | No | Sets the keyboard type. |
| `network` | No | Specifies network settings for the installed system. |
| `paranoid` | No | Causes warning messages to interrupt installation. Without it, warnings are logged. |
| `part` or `partition` | No | Creates an extra VMFS datastore on the system. Cannot be used on the same disk as `install`. |
| `reboot` | No | Reboots the machine after scripted installation completes. |
| `rootpw` | Yes | Sets the root password. |
| `serialnum` or `vmserialnum` | No | Configures licensing. Starting with ESX 9.0, ESX is licensed automatically after vCenter is licensed. |
| `upgrade` | Conditional | Specifies an upgrade. One of `install`, `upgrade`, or `installorupgrade` is required. |
| `%include` or `include` | No | Specifies another installation script to parse. |
| `%pre` | No | Runs a script before kickstart configuration is evaluated. |
| `%post` | No | Runs after package installation is complete. Multiple sections run in order. |
| `%firstboot` | No | Creates an init script that runs only during first boot. It does not run if Secure Boot is enabled. |

### `clearpart` options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--drives=` | Removes partitions on the specified drives. |
| `--alldrives` | Allows clearing partitions on every drive. |
| `--ignoredrives=` | Removes partitions on all drives except those specified. Required unless `--drives=` or `--alldrives` is specified. |
| `--overwritevmfs` | Allows overwriting VMFS partitions on specified drives. By default, VMFS partitions are not overwritten. |
| `--firstdisk=disk-type1[,disk-type2,...]` | Partitions the first eligible disk found using the specified filter order. |

Default disk eligibility order for `--firstdisk`:

1. Locally attached storage: `local`
2. Network storage: `remote`

You can override the default order with a comma-separated filter list. Filters can include ESX state, model/vendor information, or VMkernel driver names. Example:

```text
--firstdisk=ST3120814A,mptsas,local
```

Useful filters:

| Filter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `esx` | First disk with ESX installed. |
| `localesx` | Local storage that contains an ESX image. |
| `remoteesx` | Remote storage that contains an ESX image. |
| `model` / `vendor` values | Match by device model or vendor text. |
| VMkernel driver name | Match disks using a specific driver, such as `mptsas`. |

### `install`, `upgrade`, and `installorupgrade` disk options

| Option | Applies to | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--disk=` or `--drive=` | `install`, `upgrade`, `installorupgrade` | Specifies the disk to partition. Use a disk name or full ESX filesystem path. |
| `--firstdisk=disk-type1[,disk-type2,...]` | `install`, `upgrade`, `installorupgrade` | Partitions the first eligible disk found using the filter order. |
| `--ignoressd` | `install` with `--firstdisk` | Excludes SSDs from eligibility. Invalid with `--disk`, `--drive`, `upgrade`, and `installorupgrade`. |
| `--overwritevsan` | `install`, `installorupgrade` | Required when installing on a disk that is part of a vSAN disk group. If no vSAN partition exists on the selected disk, installation fails. |
| `--overwritevmfs` | `install`, `installorupgrade` | Allows installation where an existing VMFS datastore exists. Required to overwrite VMFS during install. |
| `--preservevmfs` | `install` | Preserves an existing VMFS datastore during installation. |
| `--novmfsondisk` | `install` | Prevents a VMFS partition from being created on this disk. Use with `--overwritevmfs` if a VMFS partition exists. |
| `--systemdisk` | `install` | When booting from USB or SD, specifies the local persistent disk for ESX-OSData. |
| `--repartitionsystemdisk` | `install` | Repartitions the persistent disk specified by `systemDisk` if it is not empty or contains a datastore. |
| `--forceunsupportedinstall` | `install` | Blocks the installation of deprecated CPUs. |

Disk examples:

```kickstart
install --disk=naa.6d09466044143600247aee55ca2a6405 --overwritevmfs
install --disk=/vmfs/devices/disks/mpx.vmhba1:C0:T0:L0 --overwritevmfs
install --firstdisk=local --overwritevmfs
install --firstdisk=usb --systemDisk=<diskID>
```

vSAN overwrite behavior:

| Selected disk | Result |
| --- | --- |
| SSD in a vSAN disk group | The SSD and all underlying HDDs in the same disk group are wiped. |
| HDD in a disk group larger than two disks | Only the selected HDD is wiped. |
| HDD in a disk group with two or fewer disks | The SSD and selected HDD are wiped. |

If a local persistent disk is unavailable, or the disk is less than 32 GB, warning messages appear, but installation continues.

## Network boot background

### TFTP server

Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is similar to FTP and is typically used for network booting systems or loading firmware on devices such as routers.

- TFTP is available on Linux and Windows.
- Most Linux distributions include `tftp-hpa`.
- If you need a supported solution, use a supported TFTP server from your vendor.
- On Windows, the Broadcom text mentions `tftpd32` version 2.11 or later.

### SYSLINUX and PXELINUX

For PXE in a legacy BIOS environment, you must understand the boot environment:

- **SYSLINUX** is an open-source boot environment for legacy BIOS firmware.
- The ESX BIOS boot loader, `mboot.c32`, runs as a SYSLINUX plugin.
- SYSLINUX can boot from several media types, including disk, ISO, and network.
- **PXELINUX** is a SYSLINUX configuration for booting from a TFTP server according to the PXE standard.

When PXELINUX boots the ESX installer, these files are transferred by TFTP:

- `pxelinux.0`
- `mboot.c32`
- PXELINUX configuration file
- Kernel
- Boot modules

VMware builds the `mboot.c32` plugin to work with SYSLINUX 3.86 and tests PXE booting only with that version. Other versions might be incompatible.

### iPXE

**iPXE** is open-source software that provides HTTP support for network boot. It can be used to perform the initial boot.

VMware includes a build of iPXE as part of Auto Deploy. The source tree for that build is available in the Open Source Disclosure Package for VMware vCenter.

### UEFI PXE and UEFI HTTP

Most UEFI firmware natively includes PXE support and can boot from a TFTP server. The firmware can directly load the ESX UEFI boot loader:

```text
mboot.efi
```

Additional software such as PXELINUX is not required for UEFI PXE.

Some UEFI firmware supports native UEFI HTTP boot, introduced in UEFI specification version 2.5. With UEFI HTTP boot, firmware can load the ESX boot loader from an HTTP server without additional software such as iPXE.

Apple Macintosh products do not include PXE boot support. They use an Apple-specific network boot protocol instead.

### Alternative network boot approaches

Alternative approaches include:

- Configure DHCP to provide different boot-loader filenames to different hosts by MAC address or other criteria.
- Use iPXE as the initial boot loader to chain to different installers or scripts.

---

## PXELINUX configuration files

This section gives general PXELINUX configuration information. For syntax details, see the SYSLINUX documentation.

### Required files

In the PXE configuration file, include paths to:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `mboot.c32` | ESX boot loader for BIOS systems. |
| `boot.cfg` | Boot loader configuration file. |

### PXE configuration filename

The PXELINUX initial boot file, `pxelinux.0`, tries to load a PXE configuration file in this order:

1. MAC address of the target ESX host, prefixed with ARP type code `01` for Ethernet.
2. Target ESX host IP address in hexadecimal notation.
3. `default`.

| Filename choice | Example | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `01-mac_address_of_target_ESX_host` | `01-23-45-67-89-0a-bc` | Host-specific configuration. |
| Hexadecimal target IP | Depends on host IP | Host-specific configuration by IP. |
| `default` | `default` | Fallback/default configuration. |

### PXE configuration file location

Save PXELINUX configuration files under:

```text
/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/
```

Example for a host whose MAC address is `00-21-5a-ce-40-f6`:

```text
/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/01-00-21-5a-ce-40-f6
```

---

## Boot the ESX installer by using PXE and TFTP

This procedure supports both UEFI and legacy BIOS hosts.

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| ESX installer ISO image | Downloaded from the Broadcom Support Portal. |
| Supported target host hardware | Check the Broadcom Compatibility Guide for the ESX version. |
| PXE-capable NIC | Required on the target ESX host. |
| DHCP server | Must be configurable for PXE booting. |
| TFTP server | Required. |
| Network security | Allow TFTP traffic, UDP port 69. |
| Firmware/networking | Legacy BIOS supports IPv4 only. UEFI PXE supports IPv4 or IPv6. |
| Optional kickstart file | Used for scripted installation. |
| VLAN support | Use a native VLAN in most cases. If specifying VLAN ID for PXE boot, verify NIC support. |
| SYSLINUX 3.86 | Required for legacy BIOS systems. |

For legacy BIOS machines, the procedure supports booting multiple ESX installer versions using the same `pxelinux.0` loader and different PXELINUX configuration files based on MAC address.

For UEFI machines, the procedure supports booting multiple ESX installer versions using the same `mboot.efi` loader and different `boot.cfg` files based on MAC address.

### Legacy BIOS PXELINUX setup

1. Obtain SYSLINUX version 3.86.
2. Unpack it.
3. Copy `pxelinux.0` to the top-level `/tftpboot` directory.
4. Create a PXELINUX configuration file.

Example PXELINUX configuration:

```text
DEFAULT install
NOHALT 1
LABEL install
  KERNEL ESX-9.x.x-XXXXXX/mboot.c32
  APPEND -c ESX-9.x.x-XXXXXX/boot.cfg
  IPAPPEND 2
```

`ESX-9.x.x-XXXXXX` is the TFTP subdirectory containing the ESX installer files.

Save the PXELINUX configuration under:

```text
/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/
```

| Desired behavior | Filename |
| --- | --- |
| Same installer for all hosts | `default` |
| Different installer for one host | `01-mac_address_of_target_ESX_host`, for example `01-23-45-67-89-0a-bc` |

### UEFI PXE setup

1. Copy these files from the ESX installer ISO to `/tftpboot`:

   ```text
   efi/boot/bootx64.efi
   efi/boot/crypto64.efi
   ```

2. Rename `efi/boot/bootx64.efi` to:

   ```text
   mboot.efi
   ```

Newer versions of `mboot.efi` can generally boot older ESX versions. Older versions might not boot newer ESX versions. If you boot different ESX versions, use `mboot.efi` from the newest ESX version.

### Common PXE/TFTP installer setup

1. Configure the DHCP server.
2. Create a TFTP subdirectory for the ESX installer files, for example:

   ```text
   /tftpboot/ESX-9.x.x-xxxxx
   ```

3. Copy the ESX installer image contents into that directory.
4. Modify `boot.cfg`.

Add a `prefix` line:

```ini
prefix=ESX-9.x.x-xxxxxx
```

Then apply these edits:

- If filenames in `kernel=` and `modules=` begin with `/`, remove the leading `/`.
- If `kernelopt=` contains `cdromBoot`, remove only `cdromBoot`.
- For scripted installation, add `kernelopt=` after the `kernel` command to specify the kickstart location.

Example:

```ini
kernelopt=ks=http://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/esxi_ksFiles/ks.cfg
```

### UEFI host-specific `boot.cfg`

| Desired behavior | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Same installer for all UEFI hosts | Copy or link `boot.cfg` to `/tftpboot/boot.cfg`. |
| Different installer per UEFI host | Create `/tftpboot/01-mac_address_of_target_ESX_host/` and place that host's `boot.cfg` there. |

Example host-specific path:

```text
/tftpboot/01-23-45-67-89-0a-bc/boot.cfg
```

---

## Boot the ESX installer by using iPXE and HTTP

You can use iPXE to boot the ESX installer from an HTTP server. The prerequisites and steps depend on whether the host uses UEFI or legacy BIOS firmware.

### Prerequisites for iPXE and HTTP

| Requirement | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| ESX installer ISO image | Downloaded from the Broadcom Support Portal. |
| Supported target host hardware | Check the Broadcom Compatibility Guide. |
| PXE-capable NIC | Required on the target ESX host. |
| DHCP server | Must be configurable for PXE booting. |
| TFTP server | Required for initial iPXE/PXE boot. |
| TFTP network access | Allow UDP port 69. |
| HTTP server | Must be accessible by target ESX hosts. |
| Firmware/networking | Legacy BIOS supports IPv4 only. UEFI PXE supports IPv4 or IPv6. |
| Optional kickstart file | Used for scripted installation. |
| VLAN support | Use a native VLAN in most cases. If specifying VLAN ID, verify NIC support. |
| SYSLINUX 3.86 | Required for legacy BIOS systems. |

### Build and copy iPXE

Obtain the iPXE source code and build the required binary.

For legacy BIOS hosts:

```bash
make bin/undionly.kpxe
```

For UEFI hosts:

```bash
make bin-x86_64-efi/snponly.efi
```

Copy the resulting file to your TFTP root:

```text
/tftpboot/undionly.kpxe
/tftpboot/snponly.efi
```

### Legacy BIOS with PXELINUX

For legacy BIOS hosts, also configure PXELINUX:

1. Obtain SYSLINUX 3.86.
2. Copy `pxelinux.0` to `/tftpboot`.
3. Create a PXELINUX configuration file.

Example:

```text
DEFAULT install
NOHALT 1
LABEL install
  KERNEL ESX-9.x.x-XXXXXX/mboot.c32
  APPEND -c ESX-9.x.x-XXXXXX/boot.cfg
  IPAPPEND 2
```

Save the file under:

```text
/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/
```

| Desired behavior | Filename |
| --- | --- |
| Same installer for all hosts | `default` |
| Different installer for one host | `01-mac_address_of_target_ESX_host`, for example `01-23-45-67-89-0a-bc` |

### UEFI iPXE setup

For UEFI hosts:

1. Copy `efi/boot/bootx64.efi` from the ESX ISO to `/tftpboot`.
2. Rename it to `mboot.efi`.

Use the newest `mboot.efi` if you plan to boot multiple ESX versions.

### HTTP installer layout

1. Configure DHCP.
2. Create an HTTP directory with the same name as the ESX installer version, for example:

   ```text
   /var/www/html/ESX-9.x.x-XXXXXX
   ```

3. Copy the ESX installer image contents into that directory.
4. Modify `boot.cfg`.

Add:

```ini
prefix=http://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/ESX-9.x.x-XXXXXX
```

Then apply these edits:

- Remove leading `/` from `kernel=` and `modules=` paths.
- Remove only `cdromBoot` from `kernelopt=` if present.
- For scripted installs, add a `kernelopt=` line pointing to the kickstart file.

Example:

```ini
kernelopt=ks=http://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/esxi_ksFiles/ks.cfg
```

### UEFI host-specific `boot.cfg` for iPXE/HTTP

| Desired behavior | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Same installer for all UEFI hosts | Copy or link `boot.cfg` to `/tftpboot/boot.cfg`. |
| Different installer per UEFI host | Create `/tftpboot/01-mac_address_of_target_ESX_host/` and place that host's `boot.cfg` there. |

Example:

```text
/tftpboot/01-23-45-67-89-0a-bc/boot.cfg
```

---

## Boot the ESX installer by using native UEFI HTTP

Native UEFI HTTP boot does not require PXELINUX or iPXE if the firmware supports HTTP boot.

### Prerequisites for using native UEFI HTTP

| Requirement | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| UEFI firmware with HTTP boot | Required on the ESX host. |
| ESX installer ISO image | Downloaded from the Broadcom Support Portal. |
| Supported target host hardware | Check the Broadcom Compatibility Guide. |
| UEFI networking support | Required on the target NIC. |
| DHCP server | Must be configurable for UEFI HTTP booting. |
| Optional kickstart file | Used for scripted installation. |
| VLAN support | Use a native VLAN in most cases. If specifying VLAN ID for HTTP(S) boot, verify NIC support. |

Native UEFI HTTP supports booting multiple ESX installer versions. You can use the same `mboot.efi` initial boot loader for all targets and provide different `boot.cfg` files by MAC address.

Do not mix IPv4 and IPv6 during the boot process. Use either IPv4 or IPv6 consistently.

### HTTP boot-loader setup

1. Copy `efi/boot/bootx64.efi` from the ESX ISO to a directory on the HTTP server.
2. Rename it to `mboot.efi`.

Example:

```text
http://www.example.com/esx/mboot.efi
```

Use `mboot.efi` from the newest ESX version if you plan to boot multiple installer versions.

### HTTP installer layout

1. Configure DHCP.
2. Create a directory on the HTTP server for the ESX installer, for example:

   ```text
   http://www.example.com/esx/ESX-9.x.x-XXXXXX
   ```

3. Copy the ESX installer image contents into that directory.
4. Modify `boot.cfg`.

Add:

```ini
prefix=http://www.example.com/esx/ESX-9.x.x-XXXXXX
```

Then apply these edits:

- Remove leading `/` from filenames in `kernel=` and `modules=`.
- Remove only `cdromBoot` from `kernelopt=` if present.
- For scripted installation, add `kernelopt=` after the `kernel` command and point it to the kickstart file.

Example:

```ini
kernelopt=ks=http://www.example.com/esx_ksFiles/ks.cfg
```

### Booting a VM with UEFI HTTP boot

For virtual machines, you can use these VM configuration parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `networkBootProtocol` | Boot protocol, IPv4 or IPv6. | `networkBootProtocol = httpv4` |
| `networkBootUri` | HTTP URL to the ESX boot loader. | `networkBootUri = http://xxx.xxx.xx.x/esx9.xxxx/efi/boot/bootx64.efi` |

### Default vs host-specific `boot.cfg`

| Desired behavior | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Same installer for all UEFI HTTP hosts | Add `boot.cfg` to the same directory as `mboot.efi`, for example `http://www.example.com/esx/boot.cfg`. |
| Different installer per UEFI HTTP host | Create a subdirectory named with the target host MAC address, for example `01-23-45-67-89-0a-bc`, and place the custom `boot.cfg` there. |

Example host-specific URL:

```text
http://www.example.com/esx/01-23-45-67-89-0a-bc/boot.cfg
```

Hosts without a custom `boot.cfg` on the HTTP server boot from the default `boot.cfg` file.

## Sample DHCP configurations

The DHCP server must provide enough boot information for the ESX host to find its initial boot loader.

- For **PXE boot**, DHCP provides the address of the **TFTP server** and the boot loader filename, such as `pxelinux.0`, `mboot.efi`, `undionly.kpxe`, or `snponly.efi`.
- For **native UEFI HTTP boot**, DHCP provides an HTTP URL to the initial boot loader, usually `mboot.efi`.
- Do **not** run a second DHCP server on a network that already has one. Multiple DHCP replies can give hosts conflicting IP addresses or the wrong boot loader information.
- The examples below are ISC DHCP-style snippets, not complete DHCP server configurations.
- For Microsoft DHCP or another DHCP server, map these concepts to that server's equivalent of `next-server`, `filename`, and DHCPv6 bootfile URL options.

### PXE and TFTP with IPv4

This example PXE boots ESX from a TFTP server at IPv4 address `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`.

```dhcpd
# ISC DHCP server configuration file snippet.
# This is not a complete configuration file.

allow booting;
allow bootp;

option client-system-arch code 93 = unsigned integer 16;

class "pxeclients" {
   match if substring(option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 9) = "PXEClient";
   next-server xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx;

   if option client-system-arch = 00:07 or option client-system-arch = 00:09 {
      filename = "mboot.efi";
   } else {
      filename = "pxelinux.0";
   }
}
```

When a machine attempts to PXE boot, DHCP provides an IP address and the location of either `pxelinux.0` or `mboot.efi` on the TFTP server.

### PXE and TFTP with IPv6

This example PXE boots ESX from a TFTP server at IPv6 address `xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx::xxxx`.

```dhcpd
# ISC DHCPv6 server configuration file snippet.
# This is not a complete configuration file.

allow booting;
allow bootp;

option dhcp6.bootfile-url code 59 = string;
option dhcp6.bootfile-url "tftp://[xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx::xxxx]/mboot.efi";
```

When a machine attempts to PXE boot, DHCPv6 provides an IP address and the location of `mboot.efi` on the TFTP server.

### iPXE and HTTP with IPv4

This example boots ESX by first loading iPXE from a TFTP server at IPv4 address `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`.

```dhcpd
# ISC DHCP server configuration file snippet.
# This is not a complete configuration file.

allow booting;
allow bootp;

option client-system-arch code 93 = unsigned integer 16;

class "pxeclients" {
   match if substring(option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 9) = "PXEClient";
   next-server xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx;

   if option client-system-arch = 00:07 or option client-system-arch = 00:09 {
      if exists user-class and option user-class = "iPXE" {
         # Instruct iPXE to load mboot.efi as secondary boot loader.
         filename = "mboot.efi";
      } else {
         # Load the snponly.efi build of iPXE as the initial boot loader.
         filename = "snponly.efi";
      }
   } else {
      if exists user-class and option user-class = "iPXE" {
         # Instruct iPXE to load PXELINUX as secondary boot loader.
         filename = "pxelinux.0";
      } else {
         # Load the undionly.kpxe build of iPXE as the initial boot loader.
         filename = "undionly.kpxe";
      }
   }
}
```

Flow:

1. The host PXE boots and receives either `undionly.kpxe` for legacy BIOS or `snponly.efi` for UEFI.
2. iPXE starts and asks DHCP again.
3. DHCP detects `option user-class = "iPXE"` and returns the second-stage loader:
   - legacy BIOS: `pxelinux.0`
   - UEFI: `mboot.efi`
4. iPXE remains resident, giving the boot process HTTP capability for loading additional files.

### iPXE and HTTP with IPv6

This example boots ESX by first loading iPXE from a TFTP server at IPv6 address `xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx::xxxx`.

```dhcpd
# ISC DHCPv6 server configuration file snippet.
# This is not a complete configuration file.

allow booting;
allow bootp;

option dhcp6.bootfile-url code 59 = string;

if exists user-class and option user-class = "iPXE" {
   # Instruct iPXE to load mboot.efi as secondary boot loader.
   option dhcp6.bootfile-url "tftp://[xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx::xxxx]/mboot.efi";
} else {
   # Load the snponly.efi build of iPXE as the initial boot loader.
   option dhcp6.bootfile-url "tftp://[xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx::xxxx]/snponly.efi";
}
```

Flow:

1. The host receives `snponly.efi` from DHCPv6.
2. iPXE starts and asks DHCPv6 again.
3. DHCPv6 detects `option user-class = "iPXE"` and returns `mboot.efi`.
4. iPXE remains resident, giving the boot process HTTP capability for loading additional files.

### Native UEFI HTTP with IPv4

This example boots ESX by using native UEFI HTTP over IPv4 from `www.example.com`.

```dhcpd
# ISC DHCP server configuration file snippet.
# This is not a complete configuration file.

allow booting;
allow bootp;

option client-system-arch code 93 = unsigned integer 16;

class "httpclients" {
   match if substring(option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 10) = "HTTPClient";
   option vendor-class-identifier "HTTPClient";

   if option client-system-arch = 00:10 {
      # x86_64 UEFI HTTP client.
      filename = "http://www.example.com/esx/mboot.efi";
   }
}
```

### Native UEFI HTTP with IPv6

This example boots ESX by using native UEFI HTTP over IPv6 from `www.example.com`.

```dhcpd
# ISC DHCPv6 server configuration file snippet.
# This is not a complete configuration file.

allow booting;
allow bootp;

option dhcp6.bootfile-url code 59 = string;
option dhcp6.user-class code 15 = { integer 16, string };
option dhcp6.vendor-class code 16 = { integer 32, integer 16, string };

if option dhcp6.client-arch-type = 00:10 {
   # x86_64 HTTP client.
   option dhcp6.vendor-class 0 10 "HTTPClient";
   option dhcp6.bootfile-url "http://www.example.com/esx/mboot.efi";
}
```

## Practical notes for LabFoundry-style automation

For an automated ESX deployment system that supports multiple images and multiple kickstart files, the key inputs are:

| Object | Fields to track |
| --- | --- |
| ESX image | Version, ISO source (`uploaded` or VCFDT-discovered), source date, extracted HTTP path, TFTP support path, `mboot.efi` version, `mboot.c32`, `boot.cfg` template. |
| Kickstart file | Name, revision, database source of truth, rendered filesystem copy path, checksum. |
| Host definition | Hostname, MAC address or default undefined-MAC profile, optional static reservation IP, boot mode, image ID, kickstart ID, DHCP reservation, DNS name, optional VLAN, DHCP boot options. |
| Boot profile | One or more DHCP IP zones, Legacy PXELINUX, UEFI PXE/TFTP, iPXE first-stage plus PXELINUX/`mboot.efi` second-stage, or native UEFI HTTP; maps to zone-scoped DHCP `filename`, `next-server`, or `dhcp6.bootfile-url` values. |

Suggested generated artifacts per host:

| Boot mode | Generated file/location |
| --- | --- |
| Legacy BIOS PXELINUX | `/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/01-aa-bb-cc-dd-ee-ff` |
| UEFI PXE/TFTP | `/tftpboot/01-aa-bb-cc-dd-ee-ff/boot.cfg` |
| Legacy BIOS iPXE | First-stage `undionly.kpxe`, second-stage `pxelinux.0`, then host-specific PXELINUX config pointing to `mboot.c32` and `boot.cfg`. |
| UEFI iPXE | First-stage `snponly.efi`, second-stage `mboot.efi`, then host-specific `boot.cfg` with HTTP `prefix=`. |
| Native UEFI HTTP | `http://server/esx/01-aa-bb-cc-dd-ee-ff/boot.cfg` or default `boot.cfg`. |

A default undefined-MAC profile can generate `/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default`, `/tftpboot/boot.cfg`, and the native HTTP default `boot.cfg`. Host-specific MAC artifacts should still override that default when a matching definition exists.

A rendered `boot.cfg` should usually set:

```ini
prefix=http://<server>/<image-path>
kernelopt=ks=http://<server>/<kickstart-path>/<host>.cfg
```

For legacy PXELINUX, preserve:

```text
IPAPPEND 2
```

That allows the installer to receive the PXELINUX `BOOTIF` information.
