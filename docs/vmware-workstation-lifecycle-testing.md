# VMware Workstation Lifecycle Testing

The shared lifecycle host-state checks verify that first-boot appliances retain
`vcf-sdk==9.1.0.0`, `VCF.PowerCLI==9.1.0.25380678`, and `Connect-VIServer`
after the wheel-only test deployment.

LabFoundry can run a VMware Workstation lifecycle lab alongside the Hyper-V
lab. The Workstation path uses VMX/VMDK artifacts and `vmrun.exe`, then
delegates appliance behavior checks to the shared Python lifecycle runner.

## Topology

The default lifecycle lab creates isolated VM directories under:

```text
test-results/vmware-workstation-lifecycle/<timestamp>/vms
```

The appliance VMX is copied from the selected Workstation image output. Client
VMs use an Alpine cloud VMDK prepared from the same upstream QCOW2 source as the
Hyper-V lifecycle client.

Default vmnets:

- `VMnet8` for management, with the appliance address assigned by DHCP by
  default
- `VMnet2` for SiteA
- `VMnet3` for WAN/SiteB
- `VMnet4` for trunk-like validation

Check the current Workstation host network inventory with:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File scripts/windows/vmware/prepare-networks.ps1 `
  -PlanOnly
```

If vmnets are missing, adjust them in VMware Virtual Network Editor before
running the interop test. The image build wrapper reads the selected management
vmnet before rendering Packer variables; for bridged `vmnet0`, it uses the
active Windows IPv4 interface or the interface named by
`-BridgedInterfaceAlias`.

The Workstation management subnet must remain separate from the Hyper-V
management subnet. Unless overridden, the build wrapper chooses `.30` in that
subnet for temporary builder SSH, then leaves final appliance management on
DHCP and discovers the runtime address through VMware Tools.

## Build The Appliance

Build the Workstation appliance with:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File scripts/windows/vmware/build-photon-image.ps1 `
  -IsoUrl "<photon-iso-url-or-path>" `
  -IsoChecksum "<packer-checksum>" `
  -EnableRealSystemAdapters
```

The wrapper shares Photon ISO remastering, kickstart rendering, checksum
validation, and Packer var-file generation with the Hyper-V build wrapper.
Both wrappers use `image/common/source` for the original Photon ISO download
cache so the source ISO is not duplicated under each target.
The Workstation image installs `open-vm-tools`; the Hyper-V image keeps the
`hyper-v` package and Hyper-V guest daemons.
The Workstation build wrapper opens a visible VMware console by default. Use
`-Headless` only when an unattended build is preferred.

## Single-Command Run

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File scripts/windows/vmware/invoke-lifecycle-test.ps1
```

The wrapper selects the newest appliance VMX under
`image/vmware-workstation/output`, prepares the tiny Alpine client VMDK when
needed, creates a unique `LabFoundryWorkstationLifecycle-*` lab, runs the
initial lifecycle scenario, and by default runs the restored backup/restore
pass. Pass `-SkipBackupRestoreTest` only when the older single-pass behavior is
intended.
Unless `-ApplianceIPAddress` is passed, the wrapper waits for VMware Tools to
report the appliance's DHCP management IPv4 address and derives the appliance
URL from that discovered address.

Useful commands:

```powershell
# Print selected paths and topology without creating VMs.
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File scripts/windows/vmware/invoke-lifecycle-test.ps1 `
  -PlanOnly

# Validate Workstation vmnet inventory.
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File scripts/windows/vmware/invoke-lifecycle-test.ps1 `
  -PrepareNetworksOnly

# Stop and remove existing LabFoundryWorkstationLifecycle* VMs.
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File scripts/windows/vmware/invoke-lifecycle-test.ps1 `
  -CleanupVmsOnly
```

## Normal Test VM

For a normal Workstation appliance VM, separate from the lifecycle lab, use:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File scripts/windows/vmware/create-labfoundry-test-vm.ps1 `
  -Redeploy `
  -ResetDataDisks `
  -WaitForIp
```

That is the Workstation counterpart to
`scripts/windows/hyperv/create-labfoundry-test-vm.ps1`.
It defaults to the management vmnet only; pass `-IncludeLabNetworkAdapters`
after creating the SiteA, WAN/SiteB, and trunk-like vmnets.

## Fidelity Boundary

For ESX Storage appliance acceptance, attach an extra blank VMDK to the normal Workstation test appliance, initialize it only through global `esx_storage` apply, and apply the matching DNS/DHCP and Firewall units. Record the job ID, `/dev/disk/by-id` fingerprint, UUID mount, generated A/AAAA names, `exportfs -v`, TCP/111/2049/20048 sockets, nftables family rules, and persistence after appliance reboot. Workstation proves real Photon disk/NFS/DNS/firewall behavior; the Hyper-V/ESX 9 lifecycle remains authoritative for IPv4 and IPv6 VMkernel mounts and datastore I/O.

VMware Workstation vmnets provide isolated layer-2 segments, but they do not
match Hyper-V's explicit access/trunk VLAN port model. The Workstation lifecycle
therefore validates the appliance workflow, management reachability, service
apply behavior, tty1 console ownership with tty2 left available for normal login,
backup/restore portability, and host/client integration where
separate vmnets are equivalent. Keep Hyper-V lifecycle results as the
authoritative acceptance evidence for VLAN access/trunk behavior until a
Workstation-specific tagged-client strategy is added and proven.
