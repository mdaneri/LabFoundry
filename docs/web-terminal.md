# Web Terminal

LabFoundry provides an administrator-only browser terminal for the appliance shell. It is disabled by default and appears under **Operations > Web terminal** after it is enabled in **Settings** and the related appliance changes are applied.

## Configure access

1. Enable **Management UI HTTPS**.
2. Enable **Web terminal access**.
3. Select any additional addressed interfaces in **Web terminal interfaces**. The management interface is always selected and cannot be removed.
4. Review and submit the changed **Appliance Settings**, **Public Services**, and **Firewall** units from the global appliance-apply workflow.

Only enabled, addressed access/route physical interfaces and enabled VLANs are valid additional bindings. Missing, disabled, unused, trunk-only, or addressless interfaces fail validation. LabFoundry has no WAN interface role and web-terminal exposure does not infer internet or WAN connectivity.

On a selected non-management address, nginx exposes only the login/logout, terminal, WebSocket, and required static-asset routes. Management dashboard and API routes remain unavailable. The Public Services directory for that address includes a **Web Terminal** tile linked to `https://<selected-address>/terminal`; unselected interfaces do not show the tile.

## Session behavior

- The terminal connects automatically; there is no separate Connect button.
- One bounded server-side shell is retained per administrator across page reloads and short WebSocket interruptions.
- Opening the terminal in another browser prompts for confirmation. Confirming moves the existing shell, current working directory, buffered output, and input ownership to the new browser. The original browser shows an overlay with an in-terminal reconnect action.
- `Ctrl-D` and the `exit` command intentionally end the current shell. The disconnected transcript remains visible until a new session is started.
- Copy and download icons in the terminal's top-right corner export the visible session transcript. Their success notifications disappear automatically and remain above the application footer.
- A disconnected terminal uses a lighter background so stale output is visually distinct from an attached live shell.

## Authentication and security boundaries

The web login session authorizes access, while the local SSH connection uses a one-use browser ticket, an ephemeral Ed25519 key, and a short-lived OpenSSH user certificate issued by the appliance-owned user CA. The certificate is restricted to loopback source and disables forwarding, agent forwarding, X11, and user RC processing. Host keys are pinned locally.

This removes the SSH password prompt only. `sudo` continues to require the Photon OS account password according to the normal OS policy. Root certificates and passwordless sudo are not permitted.

The service enforces bounded idle time, total lifetime, input, output, and retained transcript size. CA private keys never reach the browser or the LabFoundry service account.

## Apply and troubleshooting

Changing terminal interfaces should make these apply units pending:

- `appliance_settings` for HTTPS and SSH user-CA configuration;
- `public_services` for selected non-management nginx listeners and directory entries;
- `firewall` for interface-bound TCP/443 access.

The Public Services renderer merges terminal routes into an existing HTTPS listener when CA or depot routes already use the same address. It must emit only one `/static/` location per nginx server block.

If apply fails, inspect the Public Services child task and validate `/var/lib/labfoundry/apply/public-services/labfoundry-public-services.conf`. On the appliance, validate nginx with `nginx -t`, confirm `labfoundry.service` is active, and verify the selected address separately:

- `https://<address>/terminal` should redirect to login or open the terminal;
- `https://<address>/dashboard` and `/openapi.json` must remain unavailable on an additional listener;
- the management `/openapi.json` endpoint must remain reachable.
