# VCF Helper

VCF Helper prepares deployment DNS desired state. It is available under `VCF
Workflows` at `/vcf-helper`.

The helper creates DNS records in LabFoundry. It does not reload `dnsmasq` or
change the appliance directly. Review and submit the changed `DNS/DHCP
(dnsmasq)` unit through the global `/appliance-apply` workflow after generation
or deletion.

The `VCF Certificate Trust` button opens the separate remote certificate task
in a modal without mixing CA details into the main DNS helper workspace. See
[VCF Certificate Trust](vcf-trust.md).

## Generate FQDNs

Open `Generated VCF FQDNs` and select:

- the deployment catalog;
- an optional hostname prefix and suffix;
- a domain from the DNS zones managed by LabFoundry;
- a starting IPv4 or IPv6 address with its CIDR prefix, such as
  `192.168.50.100/24` or `2001:db8:50::100/64`.

The preview updates as the deployment, prefix, suffix, or domain changes. A
generated hostname is formed as:

```text
<prefix><catalog hostname><suffix>.<managed domain>
```

For example, prefix `lab-`, hostname `vc01`, suffix `-mgmt`, and domain
`example.internal` produce `lab-vc01-mgmt.example.internal`.

Creating records requires confirmation. The modal remains open after creation
so assigned addresses can be reviewed. When every displayed FQDN has an A or
AAAA address, the primary action changes to `Done`; `Done` closes the modal.

## Deployment Catalogs

The catalog is versioned so later VCF and VVF releases can define different
component sets without changing existing selections.

| Hostname | Component description | VCF 9.1 | VVF 9.1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `vc01` | vCenter | Yes | Yes |
| `nsx01` | NSX Manager cluster | Yes | No |
| `nsx02` | NSX Manager appliance 1 | Yes | No |
| `nsx03` | NSX Manager appliance 2 | Yes | No |
| `nsx04` | NSX Manager appliance 3 | Yes | No |
| `ops01` | VCF Operations primary node | Yes | Yes |
| `ops02` | VCF Operations replica node | Yes | No |
| `ops03` | VCF Operations data node | Yes | No |
| `collector` | Cloud Proxy | Yes | No |
| `auto-vip` | VCF Automation | Yes | No |
| `auto-platform` | VCF Automation Runtime | Yes | No |
| `sddcm` | SDDC Manager | Yes | No |
| `vsp01` | VCF services runtime | Yes | Yes |
| `fleetlcm` | Fleet components | Yes | Yes |
| `shared01` | Instance components | Yes | Yes |
| `vidb` | Identity Broker | Yes | No |
| `license` | License Server | Yes | Yes |

## Address Allocation

An IPv4 starting CIDR creates A records. An IPv6 starting CIDR creates AAAA
records. Allocation starts at the entered address and advances sequentially
within that network.

LabFoundry skips:

- addresses already used by DNS records of the selected address family;
- IPv4 addresses used by DHCP reservations;
- generated FQDNs that already exist as any DNS record type.

Existing FQDNs are never overwritten. Existing A and AAAA addresses are shown
in the preview when available. If the remaining network cannot provide an
address for every missing FQDN, allocation fails transactionally and creates
no records.

IPv4 network and broadcast addresses are not allocatable. The IPv6 network
address is treated as the subnet-router anycast address and is not allocatable.

## Record Ownership And Deletion

New records use the catalog component description, such as `vCenter` or `VCF
Automation`, as the DNS record description. Helper ownership is stored
separately in structured record metadata with source `vcf_helper` and the
catalog component hostname.

`Delete generated records` is enabled only when at least one displayed FQDN has
an A or AAAA address. Deletion requires confirmation and removes only records
owned by VCF Helper for the selected deployment, prefix, suffix, and domain.
Unrelated or manually created records are preserved. Legacy helper records
without ownership metadata are removed only when their description exactly
matches the expected component description.

## Routes And Responses

- `GET /vcf-helper` renders the helper page.
- `POST /vcf-helper/generated-fqdns` validates and creates missing records.
- `POST /vcf-helper/generated-fqdns/delete` deletes matching helper-owned
  records.

Fetch responses report created, skipped, deleted, and preserved rows with their
assigned addresses, plus validation or allocation errors. All mutations use the
existing authenticated session, CSRF validation, audit logging, and DNS desired
state model.
