# Signed Appliance Releases and Photon Updates

Appliance Update is audited runtime maintenance, separate from desired-state
enforcement and `/appliance-apply`. The web process queues work, and
`labfoundry-worker.service` executes it as a durable `appliance-update` task.
Each manual or scheduled check/install is one parent task with an ordered child
step for every selected stream. The child owns its status, progress, timestamps,
compatibility evidence, error, and bounded redacted helper output. The parent
retains the shared source snapshot and aggregates the selected channel and
release, verified key ID, checksums, service checks, rollback result, and final
outcome.

## Update streams

LabFoundry has three update streams:

- **LabFoundry Release** installs one signed, self-contained application
  release. It replaces the former independent LabFoundry wheel and Python
  Libraries streams.
- **Photon OS** checks or installs packages only after validating the proposed
  system Python ABI against the active LabFoundry release.
- **PowerShell Modules** checks or installs the explicitly managed modules from
  their selected repositories. After installing or updating `VCF.PowerCLI`,
  the helper reapplies and verifies the centralized VMware CEIP preference at
  PowerCLI `AllUsers` scope. Explicit `User` and `Session` overrides remain
  outside LabFoundry ownership. Privileged PowerShell work uses the root-owned
  home `/var/lib/labfoundry/powershell`, so synchronized repository state
  persists without depending on the service's read-only `/root` view.

The appliance never performs a broad runtime `pip --upgrade` and never contacts
PyPI during a LabFoundry release update. Application dependencies and bootstrap
tools are exact, hash-locked wheels inside the release bundle.

Checks execute every selected child even when another check fails, which keeps
diagnostics independent. Installations preserve the safety order LabFoundry
Release, PowerShell Modules, then Photon OS. PowerShell remains independently
observable after a release failure, while Photon is marked **skipped** with an
explicit reason if either earlier selected stream failed. The parent succeeds
only when every selected child succeeds.

## Release sources and channels

GitHub is the default distribution origin:

- GitHub Releases stores immutable versioned manifests, signatures, bundles,
  and the legacy bridge wheel.
- GitHub Pages publishes signed `development`, `preview`, and `stable` channel
  pointers. Its root serves a small informational release-repository page;
  appliances continue to use only the signed JSON documents under `/updates`.
- A successful `main` CI run publishes the exact successful commit as
  `vX.Y.Z` and advances `development`.
- A protected manual dispatch may recover a failed publication only by naming
  a full commit that already has a successful `main` push CI run. The workflow
  verifies that provenance and that the commit remains on `main` before
  rebuilding and signing its deterministic release inputs.
- The manual promotion workflow advances `preview` or `stable` to an existing
  verified release. Promotion never rebuilds the artifact.

The default source is:

```text
https://mdaneri.github.io/LabFoundry/updates
```

The human-facing Pages URL is
`https://mdaneri.github.io/LabFoundry/`. The repository name is case-sensitive
in the project-site path. The landing page contains no updater state or trust
material and does not replace signature verification.

For the `stable` channel, the appliance reads:

```text
https://mdaneri.github.io/LabFoundry/updates/channels/stable/manifest.json
https://mdaneri.github.io/LabFoundry/updates/channels/stable/manifest.json.sig
```

Operators may add HTTPS mirrors and failover sources. A mirror copies the
original channel pointers, release manifests, signatures, and bundles without
re-signing them. Every source must satisfy the same signed v2 contract.
Credentials remain encrypted in the database and move to the privileged helper
only in the existing mode-0600 transient file. They are not written to
manifests, tasks, audits, URLs, or helper output.

Photon and PowerShell source fields autosave as desired runtime-maintenance
configuration. **Synchronize repositories** explicitly writes only
LabFoundry-owned tdnf and PowerShell client configuration. Their source cards
show whether that synchronization has not run, succeeded, or failed. Signed
LabFoundry sources are read directly, are checked during each update, and do not
configure pip or report package-client synchronization state.

Each source editor presents repository identity first, then its location or
discovered runtime data, followed by one grouped **Repository behavior** row.
Autosave and synchronization state remain together in a separated footer, with
repository deletion isolated as the destructive action.

## Trust contract

Appliances contain named Ed25519 public keys under:

```text
/etc/labfoundry/update-trust.d/<key-id>.pem
```

Private signing keys exist only in the protected `appliance-release` GitHub
environment. The updater rejects missing, malformed, unknown-key, mismatched,
or invalid signatures. A release may add a future public key because its
contents are already signed by a currently trusted key. Old keys are retained
until an overlapping signed release has provisioned the replacement.

Photon image builds stage the checked-in `image/common/update-trust` directory
and fail if it is missing, empty, or contains a malformed public key. The
development-only VMware `deploy-wheel.ps1` bridge also synchronizes every
checked-in `.pem` public key into the root-owned trust directory. Updating only
the application wheel cannot repair a missing trust store because the
unprivileged application does not write `/etc`.

If an appliance reports that a named channel signing key is not trusted, first
verify that the matching checked-in public key exists on the appliance:

```sh
sudo ls -l /etc/labfoundry/update-trust.d/
sudo openssl pkey -pubin \
  -in /etc/labfoundry/update-trust.d/<key-id>.pem \
  -noout
```

Rebuild or redeploy an affected development appliance with the corrected image
or `deploy-wheel.ps1`. Production operators must provision the exact published
public key through a trusted out-of-band appliance maintenance path; never
disable signature verification or copy private signing material to an
appliance.

A signed channel pointer contains its channel, selected version and full
commit, immutable release-manifest URL, issue time, and signing-key ID. The
signed release manifest contains its version and commit, build time, updater
protocol, database schema version, supported Python ABIs, bundle URL/size/hash,
and a hash for every bundled file.

The Pages root `manifest.json` is the fixed legacy v1 bridge for older clients.
New clients accept only signed v2 channel and release documents. After the
bridge installs once, the appliance uses signed channels.

## Transactional installation

The helper verifies the channel and release signatures, URL contract, updater
protocol, current Python ABI, bundle size/hash, safe archive paths, exact
content set, and per-file hashes before it can switch the running release.

Each candidate is built under:

```text
/opt/labfoundry/releases/<version>
```

The helper creates the candidate virtualenv from the ABI-specific retained
wheelhouse with `PIP_CONFIG_FILE=/dev/null`, `--no-index`,
`--require-hashes`, and no network dependency resolution. It then runs
`pip check`, imports the web/worker/console modules, and validates the installed
entry points. `/opt/labfoundry/current` points at the active release, while
`/opt/labfoundry/.venv` remains a compatibility symlink through `current`.

Before switching, the helper enables the nginx maintenance response, pauses the
web and console services, closes the worker's database session, and creates a
consistent SQLite backup. It atomically changes `current`, installs the
matching privileged helper and systemd definitions, starts the application,
and probes internal `/openapi.json`.

Any failure restores the previous release link, helper/systemd files, and
database snapshot before maintenance mode is removed. A root-owned finalizer at
`/var/lib/labfoundry/apply/appliance-update/finalizer-status.json` records the
definitive transaction result so the worker can persist the durable task
outcome. Only the current and previous known-good releases are retained; the UI
does not expose arbitrary historical downgrades.

## Photon OS boundary

Manual and scheduled Photon checks/installations remain available. Before
mutation, the helper records an inspection of the proposed tdnf transaction and
queries all repository candidates with the Photon-supported
`tdnf repoquery python3` interface, then deterministically selects the highest
advertised minor ABI. It fails closed if that ABI is not listed in the active
signed LabFoundry bundle.

If Photon changes Python to another supported ABI, the helper reconstructs the
active virtualenv from the retained offline wheelhouse before restarting and
probing LabFoundry. It does not claim automatic RPM rollback and never reboots
automatically. If OS maintenance leaves the appliance unhealthy, the task
records the transaction evidence and manual recovery boundary.

## Persisted-state migration

On upgrade, LabFoundry:

- renames `labfoundry_wheel` schedule/job selections to
  `labfoundry_release`;
- removes `python_libraries` from mixed schedules;
- disables Python-only schedules with an explicit migration notice;
- deletes retired Python source rows and encrypted credentials;
- converts legacy HTTPS `.../manifest.json` release sources to v2 base URLs,
  disables invalid non-HTTPS release sources, and removes retired per-package
  LabFoundry/Python rows; and
- records one `migrate_signed_release_updates` audit event.

Appliances without a LabFoundry source receive the public GitHub Pages source.
Existing HTTPS mirrors remain in priority order.

## Signed lifecycle fixture

Hyper-V lifecycle coverage can exercise the complete release transaction with:

```powershell
scripts/windows/hyperv/invoke-lifecycle-test.ps1 `
  -SignedReleaseRepositoryUrl https://release-fixture.example.test/updates
```

The fixture must use the appliance's named test trust key. Its signed
`preview` channel must select a healthy release newer than the image baseline;
its signed `development` channel must select a candidate that reaches database
startup and then fails the service-health probe. The lifecycle runner proves
that each release task exposes a LabFoundry Release child step, proves the
preview upgrade, expects the development parent and child to fail with
`rolled_back=true`, and compares the active release, compatibility virtualenv,
database schema hash, and user identities before and after rollback. It then
rechecks the web, worker, console, internal `/openapi.json`, and host-facing
API. Omitting the URL skips only this externally supplied fixture.

## Release operator workflow

The protected workflows use these checked-in inputs:

```text
requirements-appliance.lock
requirements-appliance-bootstrap.in
requirements-appliance-bootstrap.lock
requirements-release-tools.lock
image/common/update-trust/
```

The CI declaration fingerprint prevents dependency or Python-range changes
without a regenerated hash lock. Release CI installs only the hash-locked
bootstrap tools, verifies every downloaded wheel or source archive against the
checked-in lock, builds any missing pure wheel without build isolation, and
writes an ABI-specific `requirements-wheelhouse.lock` over the resulting wheel
bytes. It does this for CPython 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14 before running:

```bash
python scripts/build_release_bundle.py \
  --wheelhouses wheelhouses \
  --signing-key /protected/release-key.pem \
  --signing-key-id labfoundry-release-2026-01 \
  --commit <successful-main-sha>
```

Publication is idempotent. An existing tag or release must identify the same
commit and exact asset bytes or the workflow fails. Annotated release tags use
an explicit GitHub Actions bot identity and do not depend on runner-global Git
configuration.

The fixed legacy manifest must publish `v0.9.0` before any later release. The
publication preflight rejects later versions while that bridge is absent. If
an otherwise successful `main` release fails after signing but before
publication, run **Publish appliance release**, provide the exact successful
`main` commit in `release_sha`, and verify the recovered tag, release assets,
signatures, and `development` pointer. The dispatch refuses commits without a
successful `main` push CI run and preserves the normal tag/release mismatch
checks. If the tag and release already published but channel advancement
failed, dispatch the same successful SHA again: publication verifies the
existing asset names and bytes before retrying the signed pointer update.

To promote, run
**Promote appliance release**, choose `preview` or `stable`, and provide an
existing version without the `v` prefix.

Schedules for checks or installs live under **Operations → Automation**. See
[`automation.md`](automation.md).
