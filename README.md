# LabFoundry

![LabFoundry appliance graphic](labfoundry/app/static/brand/labfoundry-appliance-graphic.svg)

LabFoundry is a Linux-based, web-managed infrastructure appliance for homelabs, VMware Cloud Foundation labs, POCs, training environments, isolated network labs, and WAN simulation testing.

The MVP is a safe runnable scaffold. It provides the FastAPI control plane, appliance-style web UI, local authentication, JWT bearer API tokens, audit logging, OpenAPI 3.1, dry-run system adapters, and Windows/Hyper-V script scaffolding. It does not apply real host networking, firewall, service, SFTP, registry, repository, DNS, DHCP, CA, or KMS changes by default.

## Photon OS Appliance Image

The first real OS appliance target is Photon OS 5.0 on Hyper-V. The image
builder lives in [`image/hyperv/`](image/hyperv/) and provisions:

- a Photon OS 5.0 Generation 2 Hyper-V VM with Secure Boot off;
- updated Photon packages from the configured Photon 5.0 repositories, with a
  second update pass after appliance packages are installed;
- the `labfoundry` system user;
- `/opt/labfoundry` for the installed application;
- `/etc/labfoundry/labfoundry.env` for appliance environment settings;
- `/etc/labfoundry/build-info` for build/update provenance;
- masked `systemd-ssh-generator` so Photon does not attempt automatic
  SSH-over-AF_VSOCK sockets on Hyper-V while normal TCP SSH remains available;
- `/var/lib/labfoundry` for durable state;
- `/var/log/labfoundry` for local logs;
- fixed appliance mount points under `/mnt/labfoundry-vcf-*`;
- operator-approved ESX Storage ext4 mounts under `/mnt/labfoundry-esx-storage`, with Photon `nfs-utils` and `rpcbind` installed but disabled until global apply;
- `labfoundry.service` running uvicorn from a Python virtual environment;
- nginx enabled as the default management front door, with deployed-VM first
  boot generating the integrated root CA and `appliance:https` certificate,
  redirecting HTTP/80 to CA-backed HTTPS/443, and proxying HTTPS/443 to uvicorn
  on `127.0.0.1:8000`;
- `labfoundry-firewall.service` loading the appliance nftables firewall;
- a LabFoundry recovery console on tty1 with authenticated configuration and
  power menus, `top`, and an authenticated/audited root Bash handoff, while
  tty2 and later terminals retain normal Photon login prompts; and
- `/opt/labfoundry/bin/labfoundry-helper` and a constrained sudoers template.

Finished Hyper-V appliance VMs and VMware OVF/OVA appliances also attach two
durable expandable data disks: one for the VCF Offline Depot at
`/mnt/labfoundry-vcf-offline-depot` and one for VCF Backups at
`/mnt/labfoundry-vcf-backups`. Keep those workloads off the OS disk. On first
boot, `labfoundry-data-disks.service` labels blank attached
data disks as `LABFOUNDRY_DEPOT` and `LABFOUNDRY_BKUP`, formats them as ext4,
persists them in `/etc/fstab`, and mounts them at those fixed paths before
`labfoundry.service` starts.

LabFoundry writes operational events to `/var/log/labfoundry/labfoundry.log`.
Audit events, desired-state edits, and appliance apply submissions are mirrored
there with sensitive values redacted. The Settings page controls local file
verbosity and can also forward the same operational events to an external
syslog receiver.

The `Monitor` page is an operator-facing, read-only runtime view for appliance
resource health. It charts thick appliance totals alongside thin per-logical-CPU,
per-interface RX/TX, and unique-device disk activity over the last one, three,
or six hours, plus memory pressure and compact per-interface and virtual-machine
context. Disk Activity retains a deduplicated per-device read/write table; all
per-mount capacity presentation, including the top-level Disks metric, Disk
Usage chart, and capacity table, is intentionally omitted. Disk
activity totals count each underlying device once even when several mount rows
share it. Each chart can be
expanded into a near-full-screen view without changing its active time range;
only that expanded view exposes editable percentage zoom and drag-to-select
time-window zoom. Hovering near a sampled point or line segment emphasizes the
associated series, legend entry, and exact sample; clicking the chart or a
legend item pins that series until it is cleared or another series is selected.
The 1h, 3h, 6h, 12h, and 24h history selectors use the same sampled data. The
sampler records one row about every 30 seconds and keeps the 24-hour window plus
a small buffer. Collection uses
Linux `/proc`, `/sys`, filesystem usage, DMI data, `systemd-detect-virt`, and
`vmtoolsd` when present; it does not call privileged helpers or mutate host
services. Set `LABFOUNDRY_MONITOR_ENABLED=false` to disable both the background
sampler and request-time collection from `/monitor/data` or `/api/v1/monitor`.
When disabled, LabFoundry may read existing monitor rows but it does not probe
the host or create new `monitor_samples` rows.
See [`docs/monitor-apply-ux-design-qa.md`](docs/monitor-apply-ux-design-qa.md)
for the current hierarchy, interaction behavior, responsive expectations, and
the history of the removed Disk Usage panel.

The authenticated `/dashboard` page is the compact operations command center.
Its server-rendered snapshot shows overall appliance state, setup readiness,
actionable exceptions, valid pending changes, active tasks, enabled service
health, the management network path, and a six-entry task/audit activity feed.
Invalid changed apply units, recent failed tasks, unhealthy enabled services,
and missing or unexpectedly down configured interfaces are prioritized in that
order. Disabled optional services and unused interfaces remain quiet. The page
refreshes from the session-authenticated `/dashboard/data` UI endpoint every
30 seconds while visible, retains the last successful snapshot on failure, and
marks retained data stale. This private UI endpoint does not replace or change
the bearer-authenticated `/api/v1/dashboard` contract. Dashboard actions are
links into existing workflows; the page does not apply configuration, restart
services, or mutate the appliance.

Photon OS 5.0 GA shipped with Python 3.11, but the current Photon 5.0 updates
stream has moved beyond that baseline. On June 21, 2026, live repository
metadata showed `python3` as `3.14.5-2.ph5`. LabFoundry keeps
`requires-python >=3.12`; verify the appliance stream with:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_photon_compatibility.py
```

Build inputs are the current Photon OS 5.0 ISO URL and checksum. On Hyper-V,
use the Windows wrapper so the Photon kickstart is attached as a local
single remastered ISO instead of depending on early installer networking:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File scripts/windows/hyperv/build-photon-image.ps1 `
  -IsoUrl "https://packages.broadcom.com/photon/5.0/GA/iso/photon-5.0-dde71ec57.x86_64.iso" `
  -IsoChecksum "sha512:6a7a258399a258da742032987c043ab25503698d35edafaf1ae000f12127da1a161d8b84caa17fd8f23d129e81e1faa7ab087c20ab9229772a643f8f9475305f" `
  -SshPassword "<one-time-build-root-password>" `
  -BootstrapAdminPassword "<initial-labfoundry-admin-password>"
```

Run Packer from an elevated PowerShell session or as a user in the
`Hyper-V Administrators` group. Prepare the LabFoundry Hyper-V management
network before building:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/windows/hyperv/create-switches.ps1
```

The Packer build VM uses the `LabFoundry-Mgmt` switch by default with temporary
static address `192.168.49.30/24` and gateway `192.168.49.254`. This avoids
fragile `Default Switch` host-IP detection while still giving the builder NAT
internet access for `tdnf update`. Unless `-BuilderStaticDns` is supplied, the
wrapper discovers the host's active IPv4 DNS servers and uses them for both the
temporary Photon builder and the finished appliance management interface, with
public DNS only as a fallback. The wrapper writes `photon-ks.json`, embeds it
into a remastered Photon ISO, replaces the ISO's UEFI GRUB config with a
LabFoundry auto-install entry, and passes that single ISO to Packer. Photon then
boots with `ks=cdrom:/photon-ks.json` without Packer typing boot commands. Raw
`packer build .` is intentionally blocked unless the ISO is marked as
wrapper-prepared; the wrapper is the tested Windows Server 2025 path. Build
runs pass Packer's `-force` flag by default so the fixed output directory can be
rebuilt in one command. Use
`-OutputDirectory <path>` to keep multiple artifacts or `-KeepExistingOutput`
when you want Packer to fail instead of replacing an existing output directory.
Use `-PackerOnError abort` to keep a failed builder VM for debugging, or
`-PackerOnError ask` to choose the failure action interactively.

The image builder does not configure a custom pip package index by default. If
your build network requires an internal PyPI mirror, pass `-PipGlobalIndex` or
`-PipGlobalIndexUrl` to set Photon site-level pip configuration before the
LabFoundry virtual environment is created. The provisioner does not upgrade pip
as a separate bootstrap step; it uses the Photon-packaged pip to install
LabFoundry so a transient public PyPI pip release download cannot fail the image
before the application install starts. Leave both options empty to keep standard pip behavior:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File scripts/windows/hyperv/build-photon-image.ps1 `
  -IsoUrl "<photon-5.0-iso-url>" `
  -IsoChecksum "<packer-checksum>" `
  -PipGlobalIndex "https://packages.vcfd.broadcom.net/artifactory/api/pypi/upstream-pypi-virtual/pypi" `
  -PipGlobalIndexUrl "https://packages.vcfd.broadcom.net/artifactory/api/pypi/upstream-pypi-virtual/simple"
```

The generated appliance intentionally keeps
`LABFOUNDRY_DRY_RUN_SYSTEM_ADAPTERS=true`. Real host mutation is staged per
apply unit after the helper-backed command path is reviewed. Build disposable
demo or lifecycle images with `-EnableRealSystemAdapters` when the VM should
actually mutate Photon services through the reviewed helper paths.
Firewall desired state is nftables-backed. The image installs nftables and
boots with management access to SSH, HTTPS, and the LabFoundry web UI.

Appliance Update is a separate runtime-maintenance workflow from global
`/appliance-apply`. Repository-style sources cover Photon/tdnf, PowerShell
Gallery or internal PowerShell repositories, and signed LabFoundry release
channels; the retired Python Libraries and independent wheel streams are not
available. Update work is queued to `labfoundry-worker.service`; the same
worker runs Automation schedules, managed scripts, and VCF Offline Depot
downloads.

Successful `main` CI publishes immutable signed release bundles to GitHub
Releases and advances the signed `development` pointer on GitHub Pages.
`preview` and `stable` promotions reuse an existing verified release. A
protected manual publication dispatch can recover an exact commit only when it
already has a successful `main` push CI run. Publication blocks later versions
until the fixed `v0.9.0` legacy bridge exists, and it refuses any existing tag
or release whose commit or asset bytes differ. The same dispatch safely retries
channel advancement after a release has already published because it verifies
the existing asset bytes first. See
[`docs/appliance-update.md`](docs/appliance-update.md) and
[`docs/automation.md`](docs/automation.md).

The exported Hyper-V appliance resets to `192.168.49.1/24` on
`LabFoundry-Mgmt`; the Windows host side should be `192.168.49.254/24`.
`scripts/windows/hyperv/create-switches.ps1` configures that address and a NAT
for the management network so Photon package checks work when the host has
internet access.

## Development

Primary workflow:

1. Develop inside WSL2 on Windows 11.
2. Run unit and API tests in WSL2.
3. Build the Photon OS Hyper-V appliance image with Packer.
4. Test the appliance in Hyper-V with PowerShell automation.

Install and run:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
uvicorn labfoundry.app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Run the repository syntax/content checks before committing broad UI, template,
or documentation changes:

```bash
python scripts/check_repo.py
```

Install the local pre-commit hook to run the same checks automatically against
changed Python, Jinja/HTML, Markdown, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, TOML, YAML,
PowerShell, and SVG files:

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

The checker is intentionally syntax-first: Python AST parsing, Jinja template
parsing, `node --check` for JavaScript, structural CSS balancing, JSON/TOML
parsing, Markdown fence/local-link checks, SVG XML parsing, UTF-8 validation,
and unresolved merge-conflict marker detection. It skips vendored static assets,
bundled third-party payloads, build output, and test-result artifacts.

### Pull requests and versions

`main` is protected and accepts squash merges only after the version policy,
repository checks, and complete pytest suite pass. Each pull request carries one
SemVer patch increment. The trusted `Version bump` workflow updates the Python
project version, Python runtime fallback, and PowerShell module version together
on branches in this repository. Fork pull requests must run the same command
before they can pass the required version check:

```bash
python scripts/version.py bump --base-root /path/to/main-checkout
```

Do not edit only one version source. `python scripts/version.py check` verifies
that all three sources agree; when `--base-root` is supplied, it also requires
the pull request to be exactly one patch above its base. Updating an older pull
request from `main` lets the workflow recalculate the next unused patch version.

The application update build continues to append `+g<commit>` metadata to wheel
versions. A merged pull request does not create a Git tag, GitHub release, or
changelog entry; those remain deliberate release-management actions.

Run from Windows PowerShell using the WSL development virtualenv:

```powershell
wsl -e sh -lc "cd /mnt/c/Users/m_dan/Documents/LabFoundry && /home/m_dan/.venvs/labfoundry/bin/python -m uvicorn labfoundry.app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000"
```

Run in the background from Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
wsl -e sh -lc "cd /mnt/c/Users/m_dan/Documents/LabFoundry && setsid -f /home/m_dan/.venvs/labfoundry/bin/python -m uvicorn labfoundry.app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 >/tmp/labfoundry-uvicorn.log 2>&1"
```

View the background server log:

```powershell
wsl -e sh -lc "tail -f /tmp/labfoundry-uvicorn.log"
```

Stop the background server:

```powershell
wsl -e sh -lc "pkill -f 'uvicorn labfoundry.app.main:app'"
```

Development URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Bootstrap local login:

```text
username: admin
password: labfoundry-admin
```

For a real appliance image, pass `-var "bootstrap_admin_password=<initial-labfoundry-admin-password>"`
to Packer. If omitted, the image build falls back to `ssh_password` for
compatibility with early appliance builds. On Photon appliances, the bootstrap
admin also exists as a password-backed sudo OS account for local recovery and
debugging.

Default local VCF backup SFTP user:

```text
username: vcf-backup
status: disabled until VCF Backups is enabled and Local Users apply creates the Photon OS account
```

Set/reset this account from `Users`, then apply Local Users before exposing the SFTP endpoint beyond a development lab.

## VCF Helper

VCF Helper at `/vcf-helper` generates DNS desired state, deploys SDDC Manager OVAs found under `/mnt/labfoundry-vcf-offline-depot/PROD/COMP/SDDC_MANAGER_VCF`, imports the active LabFoundry root CA into VCF 9 appliances, and configures an existing VCF Installer or SDDC Manager to use the applied local VCF Offline Depot. OVA deployment and remote depot configuration are monitored background jobs; target and depot credentials remain transient. DNS creation remains desired-state only and is enforced through global `Appliance Apply`. See [`docs/vcf-helper.md`](docs/vcf-helper.md) and [`docs/vcf-trust.md`](docs/vcf-trust.md).

Default local VCF Offline Depot HTTP user:

```text
username: vcf-depot
status: disabled until VCF Offline Depot is enabled, a Photon OS password is staged through Users, and Local Users apply creates the Photon OS account
```

Set/reset this account from `Users`, then apply Local Users. The first service setup requires the changed VCF Offline Depot and Public Services units so both nginx front doors share the same authentication behavior, but later Local Users password applies refresh the existing nginx credential automatically. The same applied Photon password works in the `/PROD/login` browser form and with HTTPS Basic Auth from `curl` or `wget`. Leave `Unauthenticated access` off for normal VCF clients; enable it only for an isolated open mirror.

VCF Offline Depot uses the proprietary VCF Download Tool to stage disconnected VCF 9 depot content. Uploading the VCF Download Tool file (`vcf-download-tool-*.tar.gz`) only validates and stores desired state, clears stale generated metadata, and records that a package is ready for apply; upload does not extract the archive, create runtime folders, run the tool, or generate a software depot ID. Global appliance apply for `vcf_offline_depot` validates the rendered nginx site, runs helper-owned `stage-tool`, extracts the uploaded archive under `/opt/labfoundry/vcf-download-tool/extracted`, exposes `/opt/labfoundry/vcf-download-tool/vcf-download-tool` as the stable wrapper, records the tool version from `vcf-download-tool --version`, applies `application-prodv2.properties` to both the helper extraction tree and `/var/lib/labfoundry/vcfDownloadTool/active-tool/conf/`, runs `vcf-download-tool configuration generate --software-depot-id`, syncs intent, and then applies HTTPS. Upload Broadcom credentials through the unified Broadcom credentials modal as either a download token or activation code, by file or pasted text; existing storage keys remain separate, and credential bodies are never returned in responses, previews, logs, or job output. Metadata and binaries profiles prefer the runtime download-token file used by `--depot-download-token-file` when present, otherwise they use the runtime activation-code file used by `--depot-download-activation-code-file`. Global appliance apply records show only sanitized filenames, presence flags, generated software depot ID metadata, generated tool version metadata, and generated command intent. The generated VCFDT script uses `/var/lib/labfoundry/vcfDownloadTool/active-tool` runtime credential paths, writes the telemetry flag, supports install, upgrade, upgrade-only, patch-only, Day-N component, and ESX activation-code workflows, and writes ESX disabled-platform selections to `conf/esxUserConfig.json`. Operators can manually start an individual download profile from the Download Profiles grid; Start is disabled until that profile has a token or activation-code file, but missing profile credentials do not block applying or disabling the depot service. Start creates a durable `vcf-depot-download` task, prepares runtime credential files under the VCFDT working tree, and runs the selected VCFDT commands as the LabFoundry service user. Enabled profiles can also be scheduled under Operations → Automation. When enabled, the depot apply unit stages nginx config under `/var/lib/labfoundry/apply/vcf-offline-depot/`, serves the fixed depot store as an HTTPS static document root, uses the CA-managed `vcf_offline_depot:https` certificate/key file paths, and protects `/PROD/` with HTTP Basic Auth backed by the selected local `vcf-depot` user unless unauthenticated access is explicitly enabled.

## Public Service Front Door

VMware CEIP consent is centralized under **Settings → VMware Product Preferences**. The single appliance-wide choice defaults to disabled and is used by VCF Download Tool command previews and runtime preparation, VCF PowerCLI at vendor `AllUsers` scope, and future LabFoundry-managed VMware product integrations. LabFoundry does not migrate or infer this value from the retired VCF Download Tool-specific choice. Explicit PowerCLI `User` and `Session` overrides remain outside LabFoundry ownership.

LabFoundry renders a generated `public_services` nginx site for non-management service IPs. Requests to `/` on a management-role address keep the HTTPS management portal/login behavior. Requests to `/` on a non-management service IP render an unauthenticated public service directory scoped to the called host or IP. The generated HTTP nginx site serves only ESXi PXE paths; CA, certificate requests, VCF Offline Depot, and registry links use their app or service-owned HTTPS front doors.

Direct public service paths remain scoped per IP in the app: Certificate Authority `/ca`, `/requests`, `/ca/downloads/root-ca.pem`, and `/ca/downloads/ca-bundle.pem`; ESXi PXE `/pxe/esxi/` with `/pxe/esxi` redirecting to `/pxe/esxi/`; VCF Offline Depot `/PROD/` with `/PROD` redirecting to `/PROD/`; and VCF Private Registry as a canonical registry URL link only. The generated public-services HTTP site proxies only dynamic ESXi Kickstart requests and serves PXE static content through a narrow nginx alias on matching PXE service IPs. It does not expose CA, depot, management, or `/registry` HTTP proxies.

The public portal uses the compact LabFoundry shell across the directory, CA trust page, request portal, and depot browser. Public user pages extend `public_portal_base.html`, the brand mark links back to `/`, the header action is contextual `Login` or `Sign out`, and GitHub, Swagger, Python, and version metadata live in the shared bottom footnote. Public service cards default to hostname URLs and include a Name/IP switch near the login action; the preference is stored in the `labfoundry_public_address_mode` cookie. Card links use each service's configured scheme and port, such as the ESXi PXE HTTP port, the VCF Offline Depot HTTPS port, and registry canonical URL. Service-owned HTTPS `/PROD/` locations follow the VCF Offline Depot unauthenticated-access setting; in the default authenticated mode, directory browsing redirects to `/PROD/login`, while artifact downloads remain protected by the same `vcf-depot` htpasswd file after the depot unit is applied.

## Operational Logs And Appliance Power

The authenticated Logs page is a read-only, redacted view of fixed appliance sources: VCFDT is retired from this page, while LabFoundry App, KMS, NTPsec, Nginx, DNS, DHCP, and TFTP remain available as tabs. DNS, DHCP, and TFTP are classified views of the shared `dnsmasq.service` journal so operators can inspect each protocol without losing the common dnsmasq runtime boundary. The page fetches the latest content every five seconds and lets the operator select a 100, 200, or 500 line tail. Log syntax highlighting distinguishes timestamps, severity levels, components, identifiers, addresses, and redaction markers and is reapplied after each refresh. The log panel stays within the viewport; its header and source tabs remain visible while the terminal output owns vertical scrolling. Long log lines wrap inside that terminal scroller instead of widening the page or adding a horizontal scrollbar. File or systemd source details appear in each tab's hover tooltip instead of consuming a separate panel header, and an unavailable source disables its tab. NTPsec, Nginx, and dnsmasq output comes from their systemd journals through allowlisted helper actions; log rendering continues to redact sensitive-looking lines before display.

Audit Events is a separate Operations page because it is structured history rather than stream output. Its read-only Tabulator grid fills the available viewport and uses local pagination sized dynamically from the visible holder height and compact row pitch, without a fixed row count or page-size selector. The page size is recalculated when the grid resizes, preventing an internal scrollbar; long detail values use ellipsis with the full value available on hover. The responsive grid minimum preserves a useful working area without scrolling the parent page.

The top-right account menu contains About, `Sign out (<username>)`, and admin-only Reboot and Shutdown actions. About reports the installed LabFoundry build and Python version. Reboot and Shutdown always use the shared confirmation modal, create and commit an auditable task first, and then ask the constrained helper to schedule the host action after a five-second delay. These runtime maintenance tasks are separate from global Appliance Apply. Shutdown powers off the appliance, so hypervisor or physical access is required to start it again.

The Tasks grid uses backend-owned filtering and pagination. Status and state use fixed choices, while Task / Component offers recorded task/component choices and accepts a custom fragment. Task detail modals render redacted result payloads as wrapped, syntax-highlighted JSON audit previews. Console output omits helper execution-envelope JSON, shows process stdout and stderr separately, and colors stderr red. The task-log dialog uses nearly the full available viewport for operational output. Preview controls are overlaid without reserving blank text rows, and read-only output remains inside the viewport rather than appearing as a form control.

## Appliance Apply Workflow

LabFoundry treats service pages as desired-state editors. Routine setting and grid edits save into the control-plane database, but they do not mutate host services on each field change.

Use `Appliance Apply` to review and submit appliance changes. The bottom-left pending card and page-level review actions open a wide review modal. There is no separate appliance-apply page; a direct GET to `/appliance-apply` redirects to the Dashboard and opens the same modal. The workflow:

- lists changed apply units such as Local Users, Appliance Settings, Network, Routes & WAN Simulation, DNS/DHCP, ESXi PXE, ESX Storage, Firewall, Certificate Authority, KMS, Managed LDAP, VCF Backups, VCF Offline Depot, VCF Private Registry, and Public Services;
- checks changed valid units by default;
- shows compact summaries with collapsed, on-demand rendered config previews or diffs;
- lets operators unselect changed units that should stay pending;
- atomically creates one `appliance-apply` master task plus an ordered child execution record for every selected component, then reuses the modal as a non-dismissible live task grid;
- keeps failed and cancelled results open for inspection, while successful master-task results close automatically after 15 seconds;
- hides submitted units from the sidebar pending count immediately, while unselected units remain available for review;
- blocks other authenticated mutations with `423 Locked` while the master is active, while read-only inspection, authentication/session lifecycle actions, and safe parent cancellation remain available;
- executes component children sequentially, persists each successful component baseline immediately, fails fast on the first component failure, and marks remaining children skipped;
- retains the terminal result until an administrator closes it. The main Tasks grid exposes the same expandable master/child hierarchy and read-only redacted child evidence.

Within each selected component, helper commands run sequentially and stop on the first failure. A failed `validate` command prevents the matching `apply` or follow-on reload/sync command from running. Parent cancellation completes the currently running component, skips the remaining children, marks the master cancelled, and releases the global lock. Restart recovery fails an interrupted running child and skips the remainder before failing the master.

Fresh Photon appliance startup records a factory desired-state baseline when no baseline, appliance-apply job, or non-auth operator audit event exists. This only initializes comparison state and marks the provisioned bootstrap admin OS account as synced; it does not run helper commands or mutate host services.

Local Users stages `/var/lib/labfoundry/apply/local-users/labfoundry-users.json` and synchronizes LabFoundry local users to Photon OS accounts. Users can hold multiple LabFoundry roles, edited from the Users grid with a multi-select role editor; permissions are the union of the selected roles while Photon OS sync still applies one local account and shell per user. Each user has a desired default shell, defaulting to `/sbin/nologin`, and enabled users are created or updated with that shell. New or reset passwords are held only in process memory until a successful real global apply sends them to `chpasswd`; LabFoundry does not store local user password hashes or encrypted pending OS passwords in the database, and previews and job results show counts/status only. Disabled or removed managed users are removed from Photon OS with `userdel -r`, unlock requests reset `passwd` and `faillock`, and the desired password policy is written to Photon PAM/pwquality during Local Users apply.

Appliance Settings owns the appliance FQDN, OS hostname, resolver mode, resolver servers, management UI HTTPS preference, passwordless web-terminal preference, and root SSH login preference. NTPsec owns appliance time service desired state and NTP/NTS enforcement. The helper installs nginx LabFoundry site config, writes a loopback-only `labfoundry.service` override, applies the LabFoundry-owned root SSH and web-terminal CA sshd drop-ins, disables the retired Python redirect service if present, and schedules a short delayed restart so the apply job can finish recording before uvicorn moves behind nginx. Root SSH and the web terminal are disabled by default. The web terminal requires management HTTPS, is always bound to the management interface when enabled, and may be bound to additional addressed non-management interfaces selected by an administrator. Extra-interface nginx listeners expose only login/logout, terminal, WebSocket, and static asset routes; they do not expose the dashboard or API. Each local user has an explicit **Web SSH** permission, default off; access also requires an enabled user, an interactive shell, and an applied Photon password. The bootstrap administrator starts with permission enabled. The management listener uses the Operations/admin shell, while selected additional listeners render the terminal inside the Public Services shell and authenticate eligible local users against Photon. The terminal connects automatically and retains one bounded server-side shell per authorized user across page reloads and short WebSocket interruptions. A different browser must confirm moving that same live shell; takeover preserves its working directory and buffered terminal output while disconnecting the original browser. `Ctrl-D` and `exit` intentionally end the shell, after which the transcript remains available for copy or download and the terminal offers an in-place reconnect action. Each attachment uses a one-use browser ticket, while the shell itself uses an ephemeral Ed25519 key and a 60-second OpenSSH user certificate restricted to loopback source with forwarding, agent, X11, and user RC disabled. The certificate removes the SSH-password prompt, but `sudo` retains the Photon OS account password policy. When management UI HTTPS is enabled, it uses the CA-managed `appliance:https` certificate, redirects public HTTP/80 to HTTPS/443, and reverse-proxies HTTPS to uvicorn on `127.0.0.1:8000`. When management UI HTTPS is disabled, including after factory reset plus apply, nginx serves public HTTP/80 as a plain reverse proxy to the same loopback upstream and does not expose a management HTTPS listener. See [Web terminal](docs/web-terminal.md) for the operator flow and security boundaries.

Routes & WAN Simulation stages `/var/lib/labfoundry/apply/wan/labfoundry-wan.conf` and owns static lab route desired state, routing permissions, IPv4 masquerade NAT rules, and interface/VLAN-level `tc/netem` WAN impairment. LabFoundry has no `wan` interface role: WAN Simulation is an explicit traffic-behavior workflow, not an interface classification, and NAT eligibility is never inferred from role. Physical Interfaces owns optional static management IPv4 and IPv6 gateways and installs each configured default in both the main table and policy-routing table `100`; IPv6 accepts an on-link or link-local gateway. Routes & WAN owns non-management route gateways in table `200`, so management and lab traffic can use different default gateways without forwarding through management. Routes can target non-management access physical interfaces and enabled VLANs with IPv4, IPv6, or dual-stack CIDRs. Route-role networks forward to other route-role networks by default; access networks require explicit routing rules. NAT v1 is explicit IPv4 outbound masquerade only; there is no destination NAT or port forwarding, and the outbound interface must have an IPv4 CIDR. Route-specific WAN impairment is roadmap work tracked in `docs/routing-wan-roadmap.md`; v1 exposes only interface/VLAN-level impairment.

DNS and DHCP share one `DNS/DHCP (dnsmasq)` apply unit because they render and reload the same dnsmasq config. The Services page shows DNS and DHCP as separate desired-state rows, but their runtime status comes from the shared `dnsmasq.service`. DNS listen addresses are derived from selected access physical or enabled VLAN interface CIDRs, including both IPv4 and IPv6 when present. When Authoritative DNS is enabled, every managed forward domain emits `auth-zone`, with shared interface-bound `auth-server`, `auth-soa`, and `auth-ttl` directives; LabFoundry generates read-only SOA/NS records and A/AAAA nameserver glue from the selected listen addresses and advances the SOA serial on DNS mutations. dnsmasq treats those selected interfaces as authoritative-only, while non-authoritative listeners such as loopback retain existing PTR and upstream-recursive behavior. Generated reverse zones retain their existing PTR behavior. When the appliance resolver is still in DHCP mode and DNS upstream servers are blank, the DNS page and rendered dnsmasq preview use the management interface's observed DHCP DNS servers as fallback forwarders; converting a management DHCP lease to static copies those observed DNS servers into Appliance Settings external DNS and into DNS service upstreams when either side was relying on DHCP. DNS can render DNSSEC validation with package-provided trust anchors, rebind protection with explicit domain exemptions, temporary `log-queries=extra` troubleshooting, and operator-managed A/AAAA/CNAME/TXT/SRV/MX/CAA/PTR records. See [`docs/dns.md`](docs/dns.md) for authoritative behavior and verification. DHCP IP zones can be IPv4 or IPv6: IPv4 zones bind to interfaces with IPv4 CIDR, IPv6 zones bind to interfaces with IPv6 CIDR and render dnsmasq DHCPv6/RA config. Each DHCP zone uses one comma-separated range expression, such as `192.168.87.100-200, 192.168.87.222, 192.168.87.226-228` for a `/24` or `192.168.87.100-87.200` for a `/16`; IPv6 ranges use full IPv6 addresses. Live lease readback uses the LabFoundry-owned dnsmasq lease file under `/var/lib/labfoundry/dnsmasq/`. The **NTP / NTS** page owns NTPsec desired state, including its upstream grid, explicit address binding, restrictive client access, `tos minsane`, source health through `ntpq`, and Firewall-owned UDP/123. The helper requires Photon’s `ntpsec` package and NTPsec binary identity. Fresh desired state uses NTS-enabled `time.cloudflare.com` and `nts.netnod.se`; NTS server mode uses CA-managed certificate material, persistent cookie keys, and Firewall-owned TCP/4460 while ordinary NTP remains available. Certificate Authority stores CA and leaf private keys encrypted in the database with `LABFOUNDRY_SECRETS_KEY`, auto-ensures VCF/KMS/service certificates when enabled, and stages `/var/lib/labfoundry/apply/ca/labfoundry-ca.json`; the helper writes public bundles and service certificate/key files under `/etc/labfoundry`. The public CA portal defaults to `ca.labfoundry.internal`: `/` shows public trust material and `/requests` is the authenticated certificate request/revocation workflow. The management console keeps CA configuration under `/certificate-authority`; `/ca` and `/ca/requests` remain compatibility paths.

ESXi PXE stores Kickstart source files in the LabFoundry database. The database is the source of truth; generated files under `/var/lib/labfoundry/pxe/http/esxi/ks/<id>.cfg` are runtime copies for drift/apply bookkeeping, while boot-time Kickstart responses are rendered dynamically by LabFoundry from `/pxe/esxi/ks/<file>.cfg?mac=<normalized-mac>`. Kickstart templates may use restricted `{{variable}}` markers such as `{{host.hostname}}`, `{{host.ip_address}}`, `{{dhcp.gateway}}`, `{{dhcp.netmask}}`, `{{dhcp.dns_servers}}`, `{{dhcp.ntp_servers}}`, `{{dhcp.domain}}`, `{{pxe.http_base_url}}`, and per-host custom values under `{{custom.<name>}}`. Missing, invalid, disabled, or unknown MAC selectors return an error; LabFoundry does not infer MAC addresses from source IP or leases. Saving in the CodeMirror editor updates desired state and marks the `esxi_pxe` apply unit changed. ESXi PXE boot settings select one or more IPv4 DHCP IP zones instead of a freeform interface/IP pair; LabFoundry derives the PXE interfaces, TFTP server addresses, DNS records, firewall bind targets, and dnsmasq scope tags from those zones. Native UEFI HTTP URLs are generated per selected IPv4 zone unless an operator supplies a manual absolute URL. Installer ISO choices are discovered from `/mnt/labfoundry-vcf-offline-depot/PROD/COMP/ESX_HOST`, the VCFDT ESX host component folder; LabFoundry creates that folder when needed, marks VCFDT-discovered images separately from user-uploaded images with dates, and lets operators upload or delete `.iso` files from the Installer ISOs tab. Deleting an ISO clears host/default PXE references to that image; generated runtime files are reconciled on the next global apply. Host PXE definitions are edited in the Host References grid, can reference both a database Kickstart and a selected installer ISO path, may include an optional IP address that creates an ESXi-managed DHCP reservation plus DNS A/AAAA record, and include custom Kickstart variables as JSON. The default/undefined-MAC profile can boot installer media but cannot use a Kickstart because dynamic Kickstart rendering requires a defined host MAC. Global appliance apply stages schema-v2 `/var/lib/labfoundry/apply/esxi-pxe/labfoundry-esxi-pxe.json`, validates selected ISO paths stay under the ESX_HOST folder, extracts selected installers to `/var/lib/labfoundry/pxe/http/esxi/images/<image-key>/`, generates default and host-specific `boot.cfg` plus PXELINUX configs, writes an HTTP `boot.ipxe` entrypoint even when there are no host profiles, stages `undionly.kpxe`, `snponly.efi`, `pxelinux.0`, `mboot.efi`, and `mboot.c32`, installs a dedicated ESXi PXE HTTP listener on the configured HTTP port that redirects `/pxe/esxi` to `/pxe/esxi/`, serves a small `/pxe/esxi/` status response, proxies dynamic `/pxe/esxi/ks/` and `boot.ipxe` requests to LabFoundry, serves boot/image artifacts statically, records render/apply timestamps, and redacts sensitive Kickstart values from previews, diffs, jobs, logs, and audit events. The helper searches Photon package paths plus `/var/lib/labfoundry/pxe/bootloaders` for the iPXE/SYSLINUX first-stage files; Photon image provisioning stages LabFoundry's bundled iPXE `undionly.kpxe` and `snponly.efi` artifacts there because the appliance package stream may not ship those filenames. When ESXi PXE boot settings change, review and apply the changed DNS/DHCP, ESXi PXE, and Firewall units together so dnsmasq, generated boot artifacts, and UDP/69 plus the configured PXE HTTP port allow rules stay aligned.

VCF Offline Depot stages nginx HTTPS static-site config under `/var/lib/labfoundry/apply/vcf-offline-depot/`, validates the CA-managed `vcf_offline_depot:https` certificate/key paths, and installs `/etc/labfoundry/nginx/sites.d/vcf-offline-depot.conf` through `labfoundry-helper`. The default local HTTP user is `vcf-depot`; apply Local Users after setting or changing its password, then apply VCF Offline Depot so the helper can derive the nginx htpasswd entry from the applied Photon password hash. VCF Backups stages an OpenSSH `Match User` drop-in under `/var/lib/labfoundry/apply/vcf-backups/`; when the service desired state is off, the default `vcf-backup` user is disabled so the next Local Users apply removes that OS account. Real VCF Backup apply validates the selected OS backup user, installs `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/labfoundry-vcf-backups.conf`, prepares the fixed chroot volume and `/backups` upload directory, and restarts `sshd` through `labfoundry-helper`. Apply Local Users before VCF Backups when the selected SFTP user is new, disabled/enabled, removed, has a pending password, changes shell, or has an unlock request.

Public Services stages `/var/lib/labfoundry/apply/public-services/labfoundry-public-services.conf` and installs `/etc/labfoundry/nginx/sites.d/public-services.conf` through `labfoundry-helper`. The renderer creates HTTP server blocks only for non-management IPs where ESXi PXE is enabled, proxies dynamic PXE requests to the app, serves PXE static artifacts through a narrow alias, and leaves CA, certificate requests, depot, registry, and management routes on their HTTPS/app-owned front doors. When web terminal access is selected for a non-management interface, that interface's Public Services directory includes a `Web Terminal` tile linked to its HTTPS `/terminal` route. Management-role IPs stay on the management front door.

The firewall preview derives LabFoundry-managed service allow rules from service desired state, including management, DNS, DHCP, NTPsec, KMS, VCF Backup, VCF Offline Depot, and VCF Private Registry listeners. It also derives managed routing rules: route-role network pairs are allowed, explicit access routing rules are allowed, and management-to-lab or lab-to-management forwarding is always dropped. Managed listener rules default to the built-in `Any` group; operators can create, rename, remove, and assign firewall groups containing `any`, CIDRs, addresses, or other groups when rule sources or destinations need narrower access. DHCP bootstrap remains interface-bound because clients may not have an address yet: IPv4 zones open UDP/67 and IPv6 zones open UDP/547. NTPsec opens UDP/123 on selected service bind targets and adds TCP/4460 when NTS server mode is enabled. Moving a DHCP scope, service listener, or routing permission to a VLAN such as `eth2.50` also changes the Firewall apply unit. In development, system adapters remain dry-run by default and record command intent instead of mutating host services directly.

KMS / KMIP is PyKMIP-backed and intended for lab compatibility testing, not production HSM use. The KMS page derives IPv4 and IPv6 listen addresses from the selected service interface, manages app-owned A and/or AAAA records for the KMS hostname, and requires an enabled healthy CA before activation. Real KMS apply stages `/var/lib/labfoundry/apply/kms/pykmip.conf`, installs `/etc/labfoundry/kms/pykmip.conf` and `/etc/pykmip/server.conf`, and manages `labfoundry-kms.service`; the service launches PyKMIP through LabFoundry's compatibility wrapper so current Photon Python streams remain supported. Disabling KMS stops the service while preserving `/var/lib/labfoundry/kms/pykmip.db`.

Managed LDAP provides an OpenLDAP 2.6 service for VCF Automation 9.1 while LabFoundry operator sign-in remains local. Each VCF organization receives an isolated suffix and LMDB database, organization-local users and nested groups, and a read-only bind identity whose secret is encrypted with `LABFOUNDRY_SECRETS_KEY`. Organizations use DNS-style tabs, users and groups use editable Tabulator grids with add rows and context menus, and operators can generate counted synthetic users/groups with complete profiles, memberships, and one-time passwords for lab testing. The `/ldap` page owns service settings and directory data; the Managed LDAP tile in `/vcf-helper` owns manual bundles and guided VCF configuration; Backup / Restore owns the separate passphrase-encrypted LDAP recovery workflow. CA-managed LDAPS is enabled by default with a configurable port; optional plaintext LDAP has its own configurable port and is disabled by default. External listeners are limited to addressed non-management access or route interfaces and enabled VLANs, while privileged reconciliation uses local `ldapi:///` with SASL EXTERNAL. VCF configuration includes the mandatory `serviceAccount` to `employeeType` mapping, but LabFoundry does not import groups or assign VCF roles. See [Managed LDAP for VCF Automation 9.1](docs/managed-ldap.md).

On the Photon appliance, real mutating helper actions re-enter through a transient `systemd-run` service when `LABFOUNDRY_HELPER_USE_SYSTEMD_RUN=1` is set. This keeps the web control plane inside its restricted `labfoundry.service` sandbox while allowing the reviewed root helper to write approved `/etc` configuration files from outside the service's read-only mount namespace.

More detail lives in [`docs/appliance-apply.md`](docs/appliance-apply.md).

## Backup, Restore, And Factory Reset

`Backup / Restore` exports LabFoundry desired-state settings as a JSON archive. The archive includes appliance, network, DNS/DHCP, `ntp_settings`, ESXi PXE Kickstarts and host references, firewall, CA, KMS, VCF service, safe generic desired-state settings, and encrypted CA private-key material. The retired `chrony_settings` table is neither exported nor restored. The archive does not include audit events, jobs, API tokens, password hashes, uploaded secret bodies, generated PXE runtime files, or other runtime history. Restoring usable CA private material requires the same `LABFOUNDRY_SECRETS_KEY`.

Restoring a settings archive replaces desired-state configuration in the control-plane database only. Factory reset removes current desired-state configuration and reseeds only core LabFoundry defaults. It does not recreate demo VLANs, routes, NAT rules, WAN policies, trunk-only parent NIC posture, DHCP scopes or reservations, firewall rules, CA requests, KMS clients or keys, depot download profiles, or service listener bindings, including after a service restart. The core reset keeps only the appliance DNS zone derived from the appliance FQDN and an app-owned appliance A/AAAA record pointing at the management IP. The core reset leaves only `eth0` desired up for management; other physical NICs are desired admin down until an operator enables them. Disabled service settings reset with blank listen interfaces and addresses so `Appliance Apply` can submit a clean disabled baseline. Both restore and factory reset force service status rows to stopped, disabled, and `unconfigured`; host services are not mutated until the operator reviews and submits selected units through the global `Appliance Apply` workflow.

## Brand Assets

Reusable SVG assets live in `labfoundry/app/static/brand/` and are documented in `docs/branding.md`.

## Safety Boundary

Python is the control plane and desired-state owner. LabFoundry does not reimplement routing, firewalling, DNS, DHCP, SFTP, or HTTPS serving in Python; CA v1 is the exception for local trust custody, where Python generates and encrypts CA/certificate material while host file writes still go through `labfoundry-helper`.

The MVP follows these boundaries:

- App package: `labfoundry`
- Service user: `labfoundry`
- Default database: `data/labfoundry.db`
- VCF Offline Depot store and HTTPS document root: `/mnt/labfoundry-vcf-offline-depot`
- VCF private registry volume mount: `/mnt/labfoundry-vcf-registry`
- VCF backup volume mount: `/mnt/labfoundry-vcf-backups`
- VCF backup SFTP remote directory: `/backups`
- System adapters default to dry-run mode.
- On appliance startup, Physical Interfaces automatically refresh read-only Linux NIC inventory from Photon/Hyper-V and persist the observed host facts. Operators can also refresh inventory manually; observed host facts are separate from desired interface state and do not create an appliance apply job. Host NIC reconciliation matches by MAC address before Linux interface name so removing a NIC and rebooting cannot move desired state to a different adapter; removed host NICs are made inert, dependent VLANs are disabled, service listener interfaces and listener addresses are pruned or disabled when no listener remains, and the cleanup is written to the app log and audit events.
- Real network apply is Photon `systemd-networkd` backed: it stages LabFoundry's desired network state, installs LabFoundry-owned `.network`/`.netdev` files under `/etc/systemd/network/`, reloads networkd, reconfigures non-management links, and reconciles VLAN links. The appliance image's default `00-labfoundry-mgmt.network` matches only `eth0`, LabFoundry retires Photon catchall network defaults, and apply keeps management explicit while avoiding blind management-link reconfiguration. Management source networks use the management route table; access and route networks use the lab route table.
- Photon image provisioning installs Photon's `powershell` package, system-wide `VCF.PowerCLI` `9.1.0.25380678`, and Python `vcf-sdk` `9.1.0.0`. It keeps the system module tree root-owned and read-only to non-root users, verifies `Connect-VIServer` from the bootstrap administrator's unprivileged PowerShell session, records tool versions in `/etc/labfoundry/build-info`, and creates that OS account under `/var/lib/labfoundry/users` with `/usr/bin/pwsh`. Appliance Update preserves the same permissions after managed PowerShell module installs. PowerCLI is for interactive administration and reviewed future workflows; the web service does not expose arbitrary PowerShell execution.
- Local Users apply stages `/var/lib/labfoundry/apply/local-users/labfoundry-users.json`, creates or updates enabled local users under `/var/lib/labfoundry/users` with their desired shell, removes disabled or removed managed users with `userdel -r`, handles staged unlock requests with `passwd -u` and `faillock --reset`, writes the desired PAM/pwquality password policy, and clears in-memory pending OS passwords only after a successful real apply.
- Appliance Settings apply stages `/var/lib/labfoundry/apply/appliance-settings/labfoundry-settings.json`, sets the OS hostname to the appliance FQDN, configures the management resolver for local or external DNS mode, manages root SSH login through `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/labfoundry-root-login.conf`, manages passwordless browser SSH trust through `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/labfoundry-web-terminal.conf`, and can switch the management UI to CA-backed HTTPS through nginx plus a loopback-only `labfoundry.service` override. NTPsec owns appliance time service desired state and NTP enforcement.
- Certificate Authority apply stages `/var/lib/labfoundry/apply/ca/labfoundry-ca.json`, validates CA/certificate material, writes public CA bundles and service certificates under `/etc/labfoundry`, and keeps private keys out of previews, logs, and job results.
- VCF Backups apply stages `/var/lib/labfoundry/apply/vcf-backups/labfoundry-vcf-backups-sshd.conf`, validates the LabFoundry-rendered OpenSSH drop-in and selected OS backup user, installs `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/labfoundry-vcf-backups.conf`, prepares `/mnt/labfoundry-vcf-backups/backups`, and restarts `sshd`. Firewall apply owns the listener allow rule for the selected interface and port.
- Public Services apply stages `/var/lib/labfoundry/apply/public-services/labfoundry-public-services.conf`, installs `/etc/labfoundry/nginx/sites.d/public-services.conf`, renders one server per non-management service IP, and exposes only the narrow terminal route set when an extra interface is selected. It must not expose management-only dashboard/API routes or `/registry` proxying.
- Privileged changes must use reviewed `labfoundry-helper` commands and sudo allowlists. On the Photon appliance, real mutating helper actions run through `systemd-run` from inside the helper so they are not trapped in the web service's read-only `/etc` mount namespace.
- Subprocess calls must use argument arrays, not arbitrary shell strings.
- The global `/appliance-apply` workflow is the only appliance enforcement path.

## ESX Storage

Photon image provisioning disables and verifies VCF PowerCLI CEIP participation at `AllUsers` scope. Appliance Settings apply enforces the central VMware CEIP choice for installed VCF PowerCLI and VCF Download Tool runtimes; missing optional products are skipped. Appliance Update reapplies the central choice after managed `VCF.PowerCLI` installs or updates.

ESX Storage lives at `/esx-storage` under VCF Workflows and publishes ESX 9.x datastores over NFS 3 or NFS 4.1. IPv4 and IPv6 are equal v1 connection families: each share selects one addressed interface/VLAN and enables IPv4, IPv6, or both with matching VMkernel client allowlists. LabFoundry generates explicit family-specific A/AAAA target names, copyable ESXCLI and PowerCLI connection commands, the canonical `nfs.<domain>` alias, PTR-capable app-owned host records, and equivalent family-specific nftables rules. Datastore state is editable through the standard grid icon or the add/edit wizard, while a dedicated Connection Instructions tab keeps mount guidance separate from desired-state editing.

Blank whole disks require stable `/dev/disk/by-id` identity, complete job-scoped `FORMAT <volume-name>` authorization, immediate safety revalidation, whole-device ext4 formatting, and UUID mounts under `/mnt/labfoundry-esx-storage`; existing mounted ext4 volumes are also supported. Global apply stages `/var/lib/labfoundry/apply/esx-storage/labfoundry-esx-storage.json`, manages bind exports under `/srv/labfoundry/esx-storage`, and enables `rpcbind`/`nfs-server` only while valid shares are active. Removing desired state never deletes stored data. Settings backup/restore includes the service, volume identities, and shares but never format authorization. See [ESX Storage over NFS](docs/esx-storage.md) for network, DNS, mount, safety, lifecycle, and iSCSI-boundary details.

## REST API

API prefix:

```text
/api/v1
```

OpenAPI and docs:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs
```

The OpenAPI document uses OpenAPI 3.1 and includes a JWT bearer security scheme.
Physical-interface responses and PATCH updates expose optional `ipv6_gateway`
alongside `ipv6_enabled` and `ipv6_cidr`. Existing clients may omit it. A value
is accepted only for static management IPv6 and must be on-link or link-local;
setting IPv6 to Disabled or Automatic clears the stored static gateway.

Initial resource areas:

- Auth
- API Tokens
- Dashboard
- Monitor
- Interfaces
- VLANs
- Routes
- NAT
- WAN
- VCF Offline Depot
- ESX Storage status, disk inventory, volumes, and NFS shares
- Services
- Logs
- Audit
- Jobs
- Settings

Several future appliance resources are intentionally scaffolded as dry-run or status-only surfaces until their native Linux adapters are implemented.

## API Token Example

Create a bearer token from the bootstrap admin account:

```bash
curl -s \
  -X POST \
  "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/auth/login?username=admin&password=labfoundry-admin" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "development token",
    "scopes": [
      "read:dashboard",
      "read:monitoring",
      "read:routes",
      "read:wan",
      "write:wan",
      "read:services",
      "read:audit"
    ]
  }'
```

Call the dashboard API:

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/dashboard
```

Create a WAN policy:

```bash
curl -s \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/wan/policies \
  -d '{
    "name": "Slow WAN",
    "latency_ms": 100,
    "jitter_ms": 10,
    "packet_loss_percent": 0.5,
    "bandwidth_mbit": 100
  }'
```

Create an outbound NAT rule:

```bash
curl -s \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/nat/rules \
  -d '{
    "name": "SiteA outbound WAN",
    "source": "192.168.50.0/24",
    "outbound_interface": "eth1.20",
    "masquerade": true,
    "priority": 100
  }'
```

Problem-details errors use this shape:

```json
{
  "type": "https://labfoundry.internal/errors/validation-error",
  "title": "Validation error",
  "status": 422,
  "detail": "Invalid request payload",
  "instance": "/api/v1/wan/policies",
  "error_code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "request_id": "req_123"
}
```

## API Scopes

Supported initial scopes:

```text
read:dashboard
read:monitoring
read:interfaces
write:interfaces
read:vlans
write:vlans
read:routes
write:routes
read:wan
write:wan
read:firewall

read:logs
read:audit
write:backup
admin:all
```

Role checks and scope checks are both enforced. A viewer cannot mint admin scopes, and a network-admin cannot mint CA or repository administration scopes.

## Hyper-V Workflow

Windows-side automation lives in `scripts/windows/`, with shared helpers under
`scripts/windows/common/` and provider-specific entry points under
`scripts/windows/hyperv/` and `scripts/windows/vmware/`.

From WSL2:

```bash
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/windows/hyperv/create-switches.ps1
```

The scaffold uses these switch names:

- `LabFoundry-Mgmt`
- `LabFoundry-Services`
- `LabFoundry-SiteA`
- `LabFoundry-SiteB`
- `LabFoundry-Trunk`

The primary appliance image target remains Hyper-V VHDX. VMware Workstation
VMX/VMDK is also available for local desktop parity work; ESXi/vSphere OVA and
KVM/Proxmox QCOW2 are future packaging targets.

The Photon image build scaffold lives in:

```text
image/hyperv/
```

Use the existing scripts to create switches, create a VM from the Packer VHDX,
start the VM, attach test NICs, and run smoke checks. The first appliance smoke
pass should verify SSH, `systemctl status labfoundry`, web UI login,
`/openapi.json`, `/api/v1/dashboard`, reboot persistence, and dry-run
`/appliance-apply` job output.

For a normal Hyper-V test appliance, use the explicit Hyper-V wrapper:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File scripts/windows/hyperv/create-labfoundry-test-vm.ps1 `
  -WaitForIp
```

Lifecycle interop testing uses a separate Hyper-V VM set and must not reuse or
destroy the normal `LabFoundry` test VM. The simple entry point is:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File scripts/windows/hyperv/invoke-lifecycle-test.ps1
```

The wrapper prepares the tiny Alpine client VHDX, selects the newest appliance
VHDX under `image/hyperv/output`, creates a unique `LabFoundryLifecycle-*` lab,
validates DNS, DHCP, firewall, routing, NAT, WAN netem simulation, CA apply
with deterministic packet-loss/recovery proof, CA apply with a ClientA CSR
request and issued-certificate verification, VCF Backup SFTP with the
`vcf-backup` OS user, client-side connectivity, and by default a
backup/restore redeploy pass that confirms the restored ClientA certificate has
the same serial number and SHA-256 fingerprint as the pre-restore certificate
and that the restored CA archive fingerprints match the original settings
backup.
It prints a human-readable console summary, writes `result.json`, then removes
the VMs it created. It defaults to the local Hyper-V lab password for admin and
appliance/client SSH access; appliance host-state probes log in as `admin`
because root SSH is disabled by default, then run checks through sudo. It uses a
separate policy-compliant default for VCF Backup SFTP test access; pass
`-AdminPassword`, `-SshPassword`, and `-VcfBackupPassword` to override those
defaults. Pass `-SkipBackupRestoreTest` only when you need the older single-pass
run, and pass `-KeepVms` only when preserving a failed lab for inspection. Use
`-PrepareNetworksOnly` to set up the Hyper-V switches/NAT, `-CleanupVmsOnly` to
remove only lifecycle VMs, and `-CleanupNetworksOnly` to remove LabFoundry
switches/NAT after all attached VMs are gone. Details live in
[`docs/hyperv-lifecycle-testing.md`](docs/hyperv-lifecycle-testing.md).

When troubleshooting a Hyper-V builder VM, use
`scripts/windows/hyperv/get-labfoundry-vm-ip.ps1` from an elevated PowerShell session
to read the current IPv4 address reported by Hyper-V.

## VMware Workstation Workflow

The Workstation image target lives in:

```text
image/vmware-workstation/
```

It shares Photon ISO remastering, kickstart generation, checksum validation,
Packer var-file generation, and appliance provisioning with the Hyper-V image
path. The original Photon source ISO cache is shared under
`image/common/source`; the Workstation image installs `open-vm-tools` instead
of Hyper-V guest integration packages.

Build the image with:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File scripts/windows/vmware/build-photon-image.ps1 `
  -IsoUrl "<photon-iso-url-or-path>" `
  -IsoChecksum "<packer-checksum>"
```

Before a forced Workstation rebuild deletes the output directory, the wrapper finds any existing output VMX and unregisters it with `vmrun -T ws unregister` through the same VMware Workstation discovery path used by the rest of the VMware scripts. The cleanup is scoped to the configured image output directory so stale template registrations do not survive a rebuild.

Lifecycle testing uses VMX/VMDK artifacts and `vmrun.exe`:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File scripts/windows/vmware/invoke-lifecycle-test.ps1
```

Results are written under
`test-results/vmware-workstation-lifecycle/<timestamp>`. Workstation vmnets
provide isolated layer-2 segments, but they do not model Hyper-V access/trunk
VLAN port controls exactly; keep Hyper-V lifecycle evidence authoritative for
that VLAN-specific behavior. Details live in
[`docs/vmware-workstation-lifecycle-testing.md`](docs/vmware-workstation-lifecycle-testing.md).

For a normal Workstation test appliance on the management vmnet:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File scripts/windows/vmware/create-labfoundry-test-vm.ps1 `
  -Redeploy `
  -ResetDataDisks `
  -WaitForIp
```

To deploy the current repo to an existing VMware test appliance without
rebuilding the image, use the wheel deploy helper. If you already know the
appliance IP, this is the most direct path:

```powershell
.\scripts\windows\vmware\deploy-wheel.ps1 `
  -IpAddress 192.168.167.10 `
  -SshPassword '<admin-password>'
```

If you want the helper to resolve the guest IP from VMware Tools, pass the VMX
path as the `-VmxPath` argument:

```powershell
.\scripts\windows\vmware\deploy-wheel.ps1 `
  -VmxPath "image\vmware-workstation\test-vms\LabFoundry-VMware\LabFoundry-VMware.vmx" `
  -SshPassword '<admin-password>'
```

Do not pipe the VMX path or put it on a separate line by itself; PowerShell will
try to execute the `.vmx` file. The helper builds `python -m pip wheel . -w
dist`, uploads the latest `labfoundry-*.whl`, installs it into
`/opt/labfoundry/.venv`, syncs `scripts/appliance/labfoundry-helper` to
`/opt/labfoundry/bin/labfoundry-helper`, restores virtualenv permissions,
restarts `labfoundry.service`, and verifies both guest loopback and host-facing
`/openapi.json`. With `-SshPassword`, the helper uses the local Python runtime
and Paramiko so SSH and sudo do not prompt interactively. If the selected Python
cannot already import Paramiko, the helper installs it and its dependencies into
the temporary deployment directory from the wheels downloaded under `dist`; it
does not modify the global Python environment. When using `-SkipBuild`, keep
those dependency wheels in `dist` or install the LabFoundry Python dependencies
first. You can also set `LABFOUNDRY_DEPLOY_SSH_PASSWORD` instead of passing the
password on the command line. Without a password, it preserves the original
`scp`/`ssh` key or agent workflow. Helper sync matters because the privileged
helper is installed outside the Python virtualenv and is not replaced by `pip
install`. If the app takes longer to import after reinstalling the wheel,
increase the readiness wait with `-ReadinessTimeoutSeconds 120`.

Pass `-IncludeLabNetworkAdapters` only after `VMnet2`, `VMnet3`, and `VMnet4`
exist for the SiteA, WAN/SiteB, and trunk-like validation networks.

Discover the running Workstation appliance address with:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File scripts/windows/vmware/get-labfoundry-vm-ip.ps1
```

## PowerShell Roadmap

The future PowerShell module scaffold lives in:

```text
clients/powershell/LabFoundry/
```

The first generated or hand-wrapped cmdlets should map cleanly to the OpenAPI operation IDs. Token authentication should be preferred for automation. `-SkipCertificateCheck` may be added for lab testing only and must not be the default.

## Tests

Run:

```bash
pytest
python -m compileall labfoundry
python scripts/check_photon_compatibility.py
```

The MVP test suite covers auth, token revocation, scope enforcement, audit records, UI smoke rendering, and OpenAPI contract checks.
